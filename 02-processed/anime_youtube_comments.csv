k,"The recent Scar of the Praeter and the older ""Hand shakers"" took a turn for the worse.

The animation aren't as smooth as this, the story's getting no where. They don't feel as grounded as this. Though ""W'Z"" the sequel to ""Hand Shakers"" did redeem it, ""Scar of the Praeter"" took a different turn.

The over exaggerated smoke and dust effects, the baby big eyed characters, the unnatural backgrounds, the unpronounced character lines, the Fight scenes, the characters. Like, how?!

K, looking back on it look so different. Everything seemed natural (Ehem, except for the panty shots. They got..emm, A little bit overboard there along with the boob physics.) But nevertheless, that anime was so far ahead with its Story line, the pacing was just so UNREAL even for an Anime, the character plot twists and turns. The Animations and Fight scenes, the atmosphere, EVERYTHING (Except for the boob physics and panty shots.) Was just so GREAT. but the anime was also underrated and not as known as most animes of its time. Kind of like ""Hitori no Outcast."" 


I wish Go Hands Studios would create an Anime of the same quality as K.

Nowdays, the only anime from the studio which I truly have fun with is ""Setoukai Yaquindome"" (Idk if that's the right spelling.)

k,"The recent Scar of the Praeter and the older ""Hand shakers"" took a turn for the worse.

The animation aren't as smooth as this, the story's getting no where. They don't feel as grounded as this. Though ""W'Z"" the sequel to ""Hand Shakers"" did redeem it, ""Scar of the Praeter"" took a different turn.

The over exaggerated smoke and dust effects, the baby big eyed characters, the unnatural backgrounds, the unpronounced character lines, the Fight scenes, the characters. Like, how?!

K, looking back on it look so different. Everything seemed natural (Ehem, except for the panty shots. They got..emm, A little bit overboard there along with the boob physics.) But nevertheless, that anime was so far ahead with its Story line, the pacing was just so UNREAL even for an Anime, the character plot twists and turns. The Animations and Fight scenes, the atmosphere, EVERYTHING (Except for the boob physics and panty shots.) Was just so GREAT. but the anime was also underrated and not as known as most animes of its time. Kind of like ""Hitori no Outcast."" 


I wish Go Hands Studios would create an Anime of the same quality as K.

Nowdays, the only anime from the studio which I truly have fun with is ""Setoukai Yaquindome"" (Idk if that's the right spelling.)


Eeeeeeeey YEP. That very anime is animated by the very same studio as this Master piece. No wonder the animation was so Smooth.",0.10934265010351968

The characters themselves feel a bit more human compared to casts in other anime and the plot is filled with suspense.

flcl,"You know, FLCL really captures how much it sucked to be growing up during the changing times of the 90s",0.2
flcl," @IskandarTheWack  I am going to help you 

So while there are definitely problematic/inappropriate relationships featured in FLCL (Naota and Mamimi/Naota and Haruko) I would argue that they aren't glorified by the narrative by virtue of them being things that Naota has to overcome that were no longer present in the ""end-state"" of the show. In other words the fact that Naota is treated unfairly by Mamimi/Haruko is the conflict of FLCL (or at least, a very big part of it.)

Naota and Mamimi's relationship was defined by emotional labour and was framed as being a bad thing for both of them. Mamimi's entire connection to Naota was based on her inability to cope with the loss of Tasuku rather than any genuine interest (sexual or otherwise) in Naota himself. This is why over the course of the series she adopts two other distinct Takkuns, both of which are pets. She was basically using Naota as an emotional support animal and was being extremely inconsiderate in the process, which Naota disliked but chose not to fight back against until he was at his emotional limit due to a sense of responsibility for Mamimi's emotional baggage regarding his brother. I think that the fact that Mamimi is older than Naota was probably meant to extenuate this sense of power imbalance. So while Mamimi's behavior for a lot of the series is really gross and problematic that's an intentional aspect of it, and something that she ultimately has to overcome.

Naota and Haruko's relationship falls into a similar category. Similarly to Mamimi, Haruko had zero interest in Naota but was stringing him along as means to an end. She's basically the closest thing that the show has to a villain; she's a toxic, manipulative person who fills the void left by Tasuku for a bit, but ultimately Naota grows as a person and learns to both stand up for himself, and accept the fact that they just aren't meant to be together.

From a narrative perspective Haruko being older also had a lot to do with Naota's own sense of abandonment/disillusionment toward his older brother. She wasn't just someone that Naota had his first crush on, she was also someone he looked up to, and the fact that he was willing to stand up for himself and eventually say goodbye to her demonstrates his personal growth over the course of the story.

I think the fact that Naota parts with both of these characters (and seemingly winds up with Ninamori iirc, who's far more age appropriate) comes with the implicit message that part of why Mamimi and Haruko weren't right for Naota had to do with the fact that they were older and only tangentially interested in him due to personal shortcomings (Mamimi's inability to deal with abandonment and Haruko's selfish desire for Atomsk respectively.) Thanks for bringing this up btw, it isn't something that I've seen a whole lot of discussion around, and I'm really sorry about any trauma you've experienced in this regard.",0.05271023302938196

I think Pluto the anime has one major issue, and that issue is you never get to see the big cool robot fights. At a certain point it almost becomes like a joke, I guess that it’s a serious version of Astro Boy, but the anime shouldn’t have been so serious that dropping the fights that take place in Astro Boy was something that seriously ever crossed their minds as a good idea. I don’t even care if the manga did the same thing, the anime should have added the fights from Astro Boy back in.",0.031398809523809516

bento,"I bought the whole show on DVD. The obserdity of people beating the crap out of each other over food in a supermarket that is very cheap because it's about to expire is insanely funny. Not to mention, this is like the disgusting sushi in American supermarkets that taste terrible in comparison to fresh sushi at a sushi restraint. The fights are similar to a dragon ball z fight with no ki. The fight starts every day after the discount almost expired sticker label is placed on the tiny plastic box. It's so obserd fighting over this every day. And that's the appeal to this anime. Also. They refer to it as a sport for honor. Outside the brawls, they are normal, and some rival groups are friends outside the battles. They are only enemies in the supermarket. My favorite line is when friend rivals talk about it so casually. This girl character says to her friend, rival opponents"" ""Hey. You guys going to the bento brawl today."" Lol. It's just a normal thing. I loved it. I bought the only copy I saw online. I searched and when I found it. It said it was the very last copy. 🤪 to bad for you. Lol.",0.010208333333333328

Ohh yeah these last 4 episodes are finally dubbed - AWESOME!!! ٩(๑>◡<๑)۶ I absolutely love ReLIFE, it’s such an amazing anime yet kinda low-key sad too (￣^￣) It’s nice that there’s a 4 episode finale to end the anime but I don’t think 4 episodes is enough. I agree that the ending to the anime was definitely rushed to the max & that’s just about the only flaw or bad thing 👎🏻 about all this. Like really?!? 4 EPISODES??? σ(￣~￣) Seriously?!?!

trigun,"I just finished my marathon of this show and I have to say, it wasn't for me. I hate to be that guy but I just couldn't get into it. It was almost like a task I had to do just to get through it, I definitely liked aspects of it tho, but on a whole it was just average for me. The animation is not the best, but I guess that's not its fault, it's old so I can't trash on it too hard. Not only did I find the main protagonist a little annoying with his ""goody two-shoes"" don't kill anyone attitude, but the stories relationships were also unresolved. I assume Vash got with Meryl, the insurance girl, but you never find out. Vash loved Rem, Meryl had the same ideology as Rem, Meryl clearly has romantic feelings for Vash, so Vash loves Meryl too maybe? it's kinda hinted that they would hook up in the last couple of episodes, especially the final scene of the credits, but you never find out. So that was extremely disappointing to not have a conclusion for them. Also is Rem even dead? we take it as if she is dead, but I think if the show had got more episodes they would have 100% had an arc were Rem returns because you never actually see her die, but I dunno. Also Legato character was kinda redundant, he was built up to be the ""Big bad"" of the series throughout most of the show and then just killed off. Vash shoots him in the head and totally contradicts his entire character but whatever. Vash annoyed the shit out of me, how many people died just because he didn't want to kill anyone, then he goes and kills someone. And the show just kinda ended suddenly, like the final episode he fights his brother for a couple of minutes, then he wins and that's it. The End. Like what? also what even are they, plants? why do their arms become cannons? So much shit I didn't get. But maybe that's my fault I dunno, it just wasn't for me. I never like Mad Max and this is like the anime version of that. An apocalyptic sci-fi punk rock anime. Like there are mutants and giants running around and shit. 

Saying all this I did enjoy a lot of the humour, and I liked the fact that no matter how much Vash tried people around him died. It was brutally realistic and It was like he was cursed. It was actually kinda depressing. But I did enjoy a lot of stuff in the show, I didn't hate it, but I was glad when I finished it. 
The movie was absolute dog shit tho, they bring in this cowgirl character that I couldn't give a shit about and they make her the main protagonist. The insurance girls are barely in it, the biggest love interest in the show, Meryl, has less than 5 min screen time. Vash is like a secondary character in it also, the animation was a lot better, but the story sucked and half the voice actors weren't even the same. Also when is that movie even supposed to be in the Trigun Timeline? 

I give the show a 5/10 I know a lot of people like it and fair enough, this is just my personal opinion. There was just too much unresolved shit for me. The ending itself was too sudden, the romantic relationships, Rems fate, Knives fate, who was Tesla, etc etc it all just didn't really have a conclusion, so i dunno it just wasn't for me. Sorry.
Thanks for the memories Trigun, I'm glad I watched you, but I'll never watch you again.

trigun,"@Katana991 Trigun - three guns. Who exactly the three are is kind of a mystery; it could be referencing Vash and the two girls, but that leaves unaccounted several incredibly important characters, such as Knives and Wolfwood.

But, basically, it's just a name that sounds cool and gets the message across - badass gun action :D Or, as Yasuhiro Nightow describes it - ""Deep Space Planet Future Gun Action!!""",0.25965909090909095

naruto,"Why is Naruto the best anime?
First of all, to all of you who haven't seen everything from Naruto, don't say that this or this anime is the best, just watch everything from Naruto. There was a monster with 10 tails, this lived sealed in a man, this man divided the monster into 9 weaker, different monsters. Naruto got the strongest of the 9 sealed in himself as a baby, his mother and father died (the hero and ""king"" of the village) in which they lived. From that day on, Naruto felt nothing but contempt. His childhood was one of the worst imaginable. Nobody liked him, he didn't know who his parents were, but he had a dream. He once wanted to be the greatest and most important ninya in the world, but it was difficult for him, he was initially the worst in his class. But he NEVER gave up.
He believed hard in arriving his goal. More than anyone else did. He was then assigned to a team and had his first ""friends"", and his previous class teacher also respected him. From then on things only went up, he made great progress, he wasn't the smartest, but he always knew a way out- He did everything to protect his friends, his village, his homeland, what he loved. And that although he was only punished with contempt as a child and still by most of the villagers, but things turned out differently. Finally, he got very far in a competition that no one had expected, but it was interrupted by a sudden attack, Finally learned he knew the master of his father, who was not yet known to him (its meaning), who he had to persuade to train him too. The progress could be seen more and more and it got better and better from day to day, until finally the day came when a certain ""Pain"" destroyed his village and seriously injured a friend of Naruto. He lost control of himself and his monster living in him, which was trying to escape from Naruto's body. But shortly before that happened, he met his father in the subconscious, who informed him that he was Naruto's father and the ""king"" of him Village (and a hero) was. This was able to bring Naruto back under control Naruto defeated the one who had destroyed the village and has managed to bring the dead villagers back to life with the help of the real self of ""Pain"". From then on he was the hero of the village and everyone respected him! But it shouldn't have been all. There was a man who wanted to put the 9 monsters back together and literally took almost all the monsters that were sealed in other people. All that was missing was the monster that lived in Naruto and the 8-tailed monster of his friend who had become by then. Because the man didn't get these 2, he started a war to get them. But Naruto managed to take control of the monster and with this strength he tried to stop the man. And how it goes on will show.
I just wanted to suggest how awesome the story of Naruto is. For Naruto, only his friends, his village, and his homeland mattered. and he was ready to do anything for it.And that gave him the strength to get where he is now. That means it should be conveyed, that friends and targets are the most important thing in life. And of course his country.",0.18286706349206353

naruto,"Why is Naruto the best anime?
First of all, to all of you who haven't seen everything from Naruto, don't say that this or this anime is the best, just watch everything from Naruto. There was a monster with 10 tails, this lived sealed in a man, this man divided the monster into 9 weaker, different monsters. Naruto got the strongest of the 9 sealed in himself as a baby, his mother and father died (the hero and ""king"" of the village) in which they lived. From that day on, Naruto felt nothing but contempt. His childhood was one of the worst imaginable. Nobody liked him, he didn't know who his parents were, but he had a dream. He once wanted to be the greatest and most important ninya in the world, but it was difficult for him, he was initially the worst in his class. But he NEVER gave up.
He believed hard in arriving his goal. More than anyone else did. He was then assigned to a team and had his first ""friends"", and his previous class teacher also respected him. From then on things only went up, he made great progress, he wasn't the smartest, but he always knew a way out- He did everything to protect his friends, his village, his homeland, what he loved. And that although he was only punished with contempt as a child and still by most of the villagers, but things turned out differently. Finally, he got very far in a competition that no one had expected, but it was interrupted by a sudden attack, Finally learned he knew the master of his father, who was not yet known to him (its meaning), who he had to persuade to train him too. The progress could be seen more and more and it got better and better from day to day, until finally the day came when a certain ""Pain"" destroyed his village and seriously injured a friend of Naruto. He lost control of himself and his monster living in him, which was trying to escape from Naruto's body. But shortly before that happened, he met his father in the subconscious, who informed him that he was Naruto's father and the ""king"" of him Village (and a hero) was. This was able to bring Naruto back under control Naruto defeated the one who had destroyed the village and has managed to bring the dead villagers back to life with the help of the real self of ""Pain"". From then on he was the hero of the village and everyone respected him! But it shouldn't have been all. There was a man who wanted to put the 9 monsters back together and literally took almost all the monsters that were sealed in other people. All that was missing was the monster that lived in Naruto and the 8-tailed monster of his friend who had become by then. Because the man didn't get these 2, he started a war to get them. But Naruto managed to take control of the monster and with this strength he tried to stop the man. And how it goes on will show.
I just wanted to suggest how awesome the story of Naruto is. For Naruto, only his friends, his village, and his homeland mattered. and he was ready to do anything for it.And that gave him the strength to get where he is now. That means it should be conveyed, that friends and targets are the most important thing in life. And of course his country.",0.18286706349206353

Go for it, it's actually a really good anime, not just because there's crazy fight scenes and anime titties. But because the comedy is spot on and the storyline is quite interesting, the other things just add to it. I completed both seasons in 2 days, it was very fun. I give it a nice 7.5/10 and I'm a reasonably harsh critic. I put it on the same level as the anime ""Freezing/Freezing Vibration"" they are both very similar. I don't know how many people will read this comment since this trailer is 7years old, but if you're looking for something fun and interesting I recommend watching this, tho there is lots of nudity and sometimes it's kinda laughable how unnecessary it is, but still a good anime.

berserk,"Honestly, the only animated berserk that was good was the original animated series back in the 90s....

The 3D CGI Animation we'll always be absolute dog shit and no matter what Anna Mae uses it, no matter how popular the anime is, it will automatically become dog shit the moment they start using those animations.

Look at attack on Titan, for instance, everyone loved the first three seasons, but the final season comes out and they start changing the animation....  They start changing the story, they start going a different route and immediately everyone starts talking shit.😂😂



I remember the first two seasons of attack on Titan, and they were the biggest things, an anime of that year it was awesome....

But the moment they added those animations they fucked themselves.

All i wanted was to Know what happened after the last episode but a whole spin off series is nice. Im just a but worried that the main series will get popular and get a lot of haters. We got to keep this amazing thing to ourselves and now more people will get to know it and pick it apart.  I don't want inuyasha to end up like naruto with the boruto sequel lol I always felt like inuyasha is a timeless classic and I just don't want anyone hating on it like most people do with mainstream anime.,0.4484848484848485

The third movie was the first thing I saw of it, and it made me a fan.

We don't get creative anime like this. if we do it's always silly or like something wild like chainsaw man or onepunch--nothing wrong with those! Just not my thing.

drifters,Why do the garbage cookie cutters Isekai get Season 2 and not Drifters and Youjo Senki? Life is unfair.,-0.5
drifters,"The thing about this anime. The drifters are really not the heroes. No one is really ""good"" even the good guys were thinking why should they even bother to save this world. I mean when you have your main character say ""if you cant speak Japanese then you must die"" on the first half of episode one. you really are not setting up for a hero. And those characters are from our world, and our world is gray and flawed as fuck. That's why it's so good. It didnt set Hitler as the good guy. Hitler did the most hitler thing by taking a broken people and turning them into an industrial nation that terrorized its neighbours. No one would get upset for that as that's what happened.",0.13583333333333333

drifters,"Many have  said is because how ""jesus"" is depicted that might be case, but the manga/anime hellsing who is also  made by  the same author wasn't really  a popular show either( and then the abridged version came so... no once cares about the original version, thanks TFS!!) . Animes of 1 season reach more popularity than hellsing of drifters.",0.3410714285714286
drifters, @Ryder-qe3ld  I mean yeah but I think that’s just part of the charm of drifters. It’s meant to be a comedy with lots of action and when they throw in the historical part it’s makes the anime interesting. I never thought of it as a serious anime maybe because it’s so fast paced.,0.025694444444444447

slam dunk,"•	""Slam Dunk"" is an iconic sports manga by Takehiko Inoue that has become a landmark in both basketball and manga history. First serialized in the early 1990s, the series blends humor, intense action, and character development in a way that captures the excitement of basketball while also delving into the personal growth of its characters.
	•	
	•	The story follows Hanamichi Sakuragi, a high school delinquent who initially joins the basketball team to impress a girl, but soon discovers a deep passion for sport. His transformation from a brash, unskilled rookie to a key player on the team is central to the narrative and provides both comedic and heartfelt moments. Sakuragi is a flawed yet endearing protagonist, whose stubbornness and brash nature make him incredibly relatable. His journey is one of self-discovery, teamwork, and overcoming obstacles, making his growth throughout the series one of its most compelling aspects.
	•	
	•The strength of ""Slam Dunk"" lies in its vibrant cast of characters. Each team member, from the talented and serious Shohoku captain, Takenori Akagi, to the skilled yet humble Kaede Rukawa, adds depth to the story. The dynamics between them—ranging from rivalry to camaraderie—enhance the emotional stakes of the basketball games and bring a layer of realism to the team’s development.
	•	
	•	The pacing is strong, especially in the latter half of the series, as the stakes rise during the interhigh tournament. Each match is a thrilling ride, filled with strategic plays, individual brilliance, and moments of team spirit that make the victory feel earned.
	•Ultimately, ""Slam Dunk"" is more than just a sports manga—it's a story about growth, friendship, and the power of perseverance.

It could at times make you laugh ,at times serious, at times it could make  you think about life itself .The genera and the story of this is awesome. 
THE ANIMATION, SONG, QUALITY, ETC! BEST EVER!
I LOVE IT VERY VERY MUCH.

But the way the producers made the ending of the first season, Its like all ending. But then also I want to see a next season of this anime to confirm that all memories of Yuu Otosaka gone with plundering the abilities should come back and live a love, happy and peaceful life with Nao Tomori as they promised each other to be lovers forever. 
This would make me the most happy for this anime.

So to confirm this, its a humble request to producers ( those who are watching my comment ) Please make Second season of the Charlotte anime. Yeah many seasons with new ideas would be better but if you guys are thinking of only one then please make a second season confirming the topic said in the previous para.

So to confirm this, its a humble request to producers ( those who are watching my comment ) Please make Second season of the Charlotte anime. Yeah many seasons with new ideas would be better but if you guys are thinking of only one then please make a second season confirming the topic said in the previous para.

Now yeah, the anime definitely isn't perfect, while i felt like my head needed something slow and i didn’t had any problem with how slow paced the first like 8 episodes were, i can see why they didn’t gave a good impression to most people, the biggest problem the entire anime has is the pacing, it feels slow paced but it feels rushed at the same time, there's just so many world building details that could have been done better if it had more time on it, i didn’t really care about Quinn character and her death because she barely had any significant scene, i didn't felt really sad with Hoody death because we don't know much about his past with Romdeau, i was already expecting him to die at some point, but i felt so frustrated with how quick it was. And then there is the final episodes that felt so rushed, we didn’t need to see the trio getting to Romdeau i think it was fine just showing what happened after it, but the whole ""revelation"" of the ending just felt so fast, it only gave me the impression that the studio didn’t had enough budget to use all the potencial the writer had. 

But overall, the funny thing is, i barely know much about philosophy, i only recognized some of the most popular basic latin references, that i studied some few years ago, so i can't tell how much i missed and how in depth it truly is.",0.14515503875968994

ergo proxy,"Ergo proxy is for those who can understand the literature that forms the basis of its premise and message. 

And even those without it, they find themselves drawn back to it again and again for some reason because there is something about the show that nags them. Something deeply hidden under the visuals and the slow pace and the, for the surface level watcher, pretentious dialogue. And then once they peel back the layers they realize, this show was never about a post apocalyptic dystopia.. it was about self discovery and self denial and the consequences of both. It was always a journey inward.. an invitation to explore the mind.

Vincent laws journey started with him going out to find himself, the truth behind his memories and lack of them. His journey eventually found him returning to the very place he wanted to run away from.. and his final confrontation was with an exact mirror image of himself, the one he was trying to deny. His denial of himself left the city of Rondo in a state of decay and stasis, and his departure left it to die as the humans began to slowly lose their minds with the absense of meaning. When he rediscovered himself he was faced with a choice, to embrace his reason for being, the purpose he was made to fulfill, or to reject it, or to find another path and reintegrate his past self into his present, more mature whole. His denial of himself made his past self resentful and it lashed out in unpredictable ways, going as far as to kill the one that facilitated its erasure and suppression in a bitter bid of vengeance. 

This is the Jungian shadow and the fool. Vincent was the fool, but also he became the wise old man as a result of his journey of blind naivety. And finally when he opened his eyes in the end, they glow with the incandescence of enlightenment, having accepted himself.",-0.02333333333333333

texhnolyze,"I've just finished this show, and I can safely say I dislike it! [Spoiler free review]

Texhnolyze has many plotlines that do not fully get resolved, and doesn't make very good use of the promising and mysterious narrative elements it begins itself with. What begins as a surreal philosophical science fiction mystery devolves into a moody gangster 'drama' that has little redemption.

 The characters are written well, and the setting in which they play is interesting and original. I enjoyed the dark themes and how they are handled most of the time as well. But the 'villains,' if you will, have truly vapid motivations and offer nothing but chaos as a means to progress the plot. Chaos and decay are central themes in Texhnolyze, but all of its other themes are handled so much more smartly and serve its characters better. There are ultimately no answers as to why things happen in Texhnolyze, in a grand sense, other than 'villains decided to do villainous things because human nature.'

As for my personal taste, while I was hooked by the surrealism and mystery during the first few episodes, I very slowly came to be bored and then frustrated with the show. I say frustrated, because while the narrative doesn't spiral out of control, it just gets not good after about halfway through the show; things still make enough sense for the ideas to remain cohesed, yet the ideas lose their light; the narrative doesn't become unenjoyable suddenly, but rather very gradually. I also found the ending rather unsatisfying, but I don't consider that to be a fault in the show's writing necessarily. 

I had a lot of hope for this show and Texhnolyze sets itself up so well, but slowly lost me by the end. I have seen some people compare this to Ergo Proxy, which I thoroughly enjoyed, and which delivered on its premises satisfactorily.

Chaos and decay are central themes in Texhnolyze, but all of its other themes are handled so much more smartly and serve its characters better. There are ultimately no answers as to why things happen in Texhnolyze, in a grand sense, other than 'villains decided to do villainous things because human nature.'

As for my personal taste, while I was hooked by the surrealism and mystery during the first few episodes, I very slowly came to be bored and then frustrated with the show. I say frustrated, because while the narrative doesn't spiral out of control, it just gets not good after about halfway through the show; things still make enough sense for the ideas to remain cohesed, yet the ideas lose their light; the narrative doesn't become unenjoyable suddenly, but rather very gradually. I also found the ending rather unsatisfying, but I don't consider that to be a fault in the show's writing necessarily. 

I had a lot of hope for this show and Texhnolyze sets itself up so well, but slowly lost me by the end. I have seen some people compare this to Ergo Proxy, which I thoroughly enjoyed, and which delivered on its premises satisfactorily. 

I know I'm being negative, but I wanted to write out a negative review as fairly as possible without any spoilers.",0.0761139455782313

I really hated Youtube's unfair removal. I'm trying to express my sadness upon Yushi Suzuki's untimely death. The reason why I'm expressing this was because I've watched Eden Zero on Netflix at September 14th & 15th. I loved it. I'll be patient for another season on Netflix in the near future. It's just too bad that one of the creators of the animated adaptation have died in an untimely manner. As a result, the future of Eden Zero animated adaptation will change for better or worst. But I digress. If you want to know about Yushi Suzuki's passing, just look it up on the internet through the search engine. You'll see what I meant. May you rest in peace, Yushi Suzuki.

golden time,"What makes Golden Time absolutely Astounding is how it shows us the harsh reality and it's Themes are so real-life-like not that pointless repeated high school kids love sh*t.  But... nothing is perfect.


The same as toradora the damen author after making an almost perfect start and execution he decides to suddenly make the WOREST ending ever....  Sigh* I mean Golden time ending isn't that bad tbh it's just average and he somehow remembers kouko only by the love power and bla bla bla BULLSH*T!! after all that Realism why the Friendship-power-like shit that ruined the consistency 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️


If Banri never remembered the university events and kept in touch with his friends and they shared all that Ocamera videos and their memories with him and each of them just go on in his own way and that year and half they spent together remained an invaluable memory they cherish that would be more relatable and fits the storyline.

A painful ending? Yes. But a bad one? Absolutely not! Not because it's sad it's bad no it doesn't work like that, things doesn't always go as planed and that's what Golden time was about the whole time so why the sudden unreasonable change in the ending?


For me if that time they spent together remained a memory as the ""Golden time"" of their life would be 100 times better than just making a useless illogical happy ending. And if you think about it the ending i suggest is considered happy in it's own way Banri and Linda end up together as it should be from the start Oka and Mitsu ends together and Kouko eventually fall in love with someone else and the Group stay as the friends they are with alot of happy memories they cherish and some sad memories they accept and just go on and accept that they just couldn't be together the same as Kouko and Mitsu issue in the beginning. But they keep going as friends and that time will never be meaningless it's just a prat of their life so their life shouldn't just stop at this point if it doesn't work as planned.


Even Though after all that Golden time still one of the best but still had it's share of shortcomings same as the illogical happy ending that ruined the consistency and that pointless ghost that ruined the realistic theme there was a million different way to deal with his past memories other than that ghost but other than that it's absolutely great and i overall like it and that's the exact reason i couldn't hols the frustration of the ending 😅",0.12414351851851853

lots of violence 
child(ren) abuse
(it doesnt show but it talks alot of) child and adult seXual abuse and violence and assult 
its very strong yes (i very much skipped a couple scenes) ITS NOT A FEEL GOOD SHOW AT ALL, very uncomfortable if you are used to feel good action like per say HxH or MHA
but still like the best and worst most powerful masterpiece at the end

show quality plot wise 
there seems to be a main character that has it all, pretty looks, smartness 1000000, and a traumatic backround, sounds like an attention seeker right? WRONG the plot per sé of the show doesnt make it about ash him self but rather his gang and friends' mission to stop Banana Fish. Dont fret for the first few episodes as those are the ones that mostly focus on Ash

banana fish," @14Zmargarita  Banana Fish is based from a manga in the 80s by Akimi Yoshida. Be warned because it's not for the faint of heart, as it tackles real life issues like gang crimes, pedophilia, corruption, rape, and drugs. The main character is Ash Lynx (Aslan Callenreese) a 17 year old gang leader. He was a victim of CSA and was involved with the Mafia at a young age after he had ran away from home. The so-called banana fish in the anime is a kind of mind-controlling drug that causes a person to be gravely afflicted with nightmares and fears to the point of murdering others. The show is basically about Ash and his gang chasing after (or being chased by) the Mafia, and trying to put a stop on banana fish.

Escenas recicladas, paisajes genéricos y exageradamente geométricos y mal angulados, una ANIMACIÓN DEL 0RTO!!! tanto en batalla como en escenas normales!!! Y ni hablar de la historia, que lo único bueno que tuvo fue la escena de Keith con su hermana y la reaparición de Izanami, de allí todo pésimo, la ejecución estratégica de los policías es mediocre a comparación con la temporada 1, los giros argumentales estaban más que predecibles, los personajes son demasiado planos y con poca personalidad a comparación con la temporada 1, Y lo peor de todo es que solo dieron 6 episodios, NADA PRÁCTICAMENTE, para ser 3 años!! Hubiera preferido que se tomarán más tiempo, no me hubiera quejado si tardaban 5 o 7 años pero hubiera preferido eso y que lo hagan bien o incluso que simplemente no lo hagan y lo dejen así, pero por favor production I.G, no me hagas esto por favor!! No arruines una serie que tú mismo creaste! Eso es una blasfemia grandísima!!
*Suspiro* Que te puedo decir? Solo te diré que la serie terminó en la temporada 1, por tu bien te recomiendo que veas la segunda temporada como un Spinn off mal hecho (Como Boruto) y no lo veas como una continuación canónica, sinó como una OVA o un Reboot, porque con lo mal hecha que está para mí no merece ser llamada temporada.",-1.0

cowboy bebop,"I just finished my marathon of this show for the third time and I have to say the following... (Spoilers) 
What a weird show. I watched it for the first time in 2016, then 2017 and now a third time in 2019. Yet I'm still left with a feeling of ""What did I just watch"" Now obviously the animation and voice acting are top notch, but to be honest I'm not even sure I like the show. But for some reason I've watched it 3 times. Maybe it's boredom that brings me back, or maybe I relate to the characters ideologies of ""come waste your life with us"" and I identify with that, but it's hard to explain why I watched this show 3 times. The characters aren't even friends, but they are at the same time. There is a sense of love for each other, but it's so deep down that none of them will ever admit it to one another, and you start to think to yourself maybe they don't love each other. They're all so selfish, and I guess that's the point, they care for each other but don't really at the same time. I like the fact that this anime isn't a cliché ""We're a family now"" kinda thing. CB is more realistic when it comes to personal relationships and displaying emotion. It's a great anime, but I don't even know if I'd recommend it to people, because I don't even understand it myself. It also has a tragic ending, the final scenes of the characters are sad and depressing. Jet is left in a depressed state cleaning his ship, Faye is left totally alone crying, and Spike losses Julia and goes off to die. People say he might be alive, but the show has ended, it's not coming back and the director said he personally believes Spike died (and so do I) It's like ""wtf"" I just watched 26 episodes of these guys together, including a 2 hour movie that takes place between episodes 22-23, and it ends with these guys alone and broken. I'm pretty sure I don't really like this show, but there's something about it that I really DO like. Maybe it's spikes thoughts on death, or Jet's firmness, or Faye's free spirit attitude I dunno. Something draws me in, but I'm not even sure I like the way it makes me carry that weight. It's so weird. But I guess whatever happens, happens 
Thanks for the memories Cowboy Bebop, I don't think I'll ever watch you again, but I might I dunno.

cowboy bebop,"What I am about to say require a bit of context: I am a Mass Comm student and in one of my classes we had an assignment where we had to find a ""new"" show to put on a tv station. Can't, for the life of me, remember what the station was. It could be any show that wasn't in syndication or already showing on TV. I struggled, but couldn't think of anything (I don't watch alot of TV, not alot of shows interest me). So I passed the time watching anime when I had a lightbulb, why not use an anime. It was a long shot and required some thought, the station was for a more mature audience, not teens or kids so nothing that ""looked cutesy"" because I knew that it would get greenlit over the CEO'S dead body (we didn't HAVE to put as much thought as I was into it, but I do better at imagining the full scenario). So I needed a serious anime that had a fair amount of action and drama that people could sink their teeth into. The anime also needed to age well as not everyone is for the ""dated but serviceable"" shows. That's when it hit me like the Bebop coming out of a warpgate. Why not Cowboy Bebop. I showed a trailer, wrote a quick synopsis and background if the show, pitched it to the class (serving as the metaphorical Board of Directors).

So I needed a serious anime that had a fair amount of action and drama that people could sink their teeth into. The anime also needed to age well as not everyone is for the ""dated but serviceable"" shows. That's when it hit me like the Bebop coming out of a warpgate. Why not Cowboy Bebop. I showed a trailer, wrote a quick synopsis and background if the show, pitched it to the class (serving as the metaphorical Board of Directors).

cowboy bebop,"I just finished my marathon of this show for the third time and I have to say the following... (Spoilers) 
What a weird show. I watched it for the first time in 2016, then 2017 and now a third time in 2019. Yet I'm still left with a feeling of ""What did I just watch"" Now obviously the animation and voice acting are top notch, but to be honest I'm not even sure I like the show. But for some reason I've watched it 3 times. Maybe it's boredom that brings me back, or maybe I relate to the characters ideologies of ""come waste your life with us"" and I identify with that, but it's hard to explain why I watched this show 3 times. The characters aren't even friends, but they are at the same time. There is a sense of love for each other, but it's so deep down that none of them will ever admit it to one another, and you start to think to yourself maybe they don't love each other. They're all so selfish, and I guess that's the point, they care for each other but don't really at the same time. I like the fact that this anime isn't a cliché ""We're a family now"" kinda thing. CB is more realistic when it comes to personal relationships and displaying emotion. It's a great anime, but I don't even know if I'd recommend it to people, because I don't even understand it myself. It also has a tragic ending, the final scenes of the characters are sad and depressing. Jet is left in a depressed state cleaning his ship, Faye is left totally alone crying, and Spike losses Julia and goes off to die. People say he might be alive, but the show has ended, it's not coming back and the director said he personally believes Spike died (and so do I) It's like ""wtf"" I just watched 26 episodes of these guys together, including a 2 hour movie that takes place between episodes 22-23, and it ends with these guys alone and broken. I'm pretty sure I don't really like this show, but there's something about it that I really DO like. Maybe it's spikes thoughts on death, or Jet's firmness, or Faye's free spirit attitude I dunno. Something draws me in, but I'm not even sure I like the way it makes me carry that weight. It's so weird. But I guess whatever happens, happens 
Thanks for the memories Cowboy Bebop, I don't think I'll ever watch you again, but I might I dunno. 
Until we meet again.....

cowboy bebop,"What I am about to say require a bit of context: I am a Mass Comm student and in one of my classes we had an assignment where we had to find a ""new"" show to put on a tv station.

afro samurai,"Salut :)

Afro Samurai est un animé énorme ! : le chara-design est très beau, le scénario est très prenant et bien construit, l'univers est original (mixe entre science-fiction, fantastique, surnaturel et le genre samurai)le fait que la vo soit en anglais renforce cette originalité, les personnages sont très charismatique pour la plupart (cow-boy number one, Afro sérieux trop la classe ce gars)et le pote d'Afro est très attachant :p, l'ost pète grave (rien n'a envier à celle de Samurai champloo) l'opening déchire trop. Je recommande cette animé aux fans de samurai et d'histoire de vengeance ;)

A+ !! 	

Hi :)

Afro Samurai is a huge animated! : Chara-design is beautiful, the story is very engaging and well built, the universe is original (mix between science fiction, fantasy, supernatural and the samurai genre) that the vo either English reinforces this originality the characters are very charismatic for most (cowboy number one, too serious Afro class this guy) and the Afro dude is very endearing: p ost serious farts (nothing comparable to that of Samurai champloo) opening the tears too. I recommend this to fans of animated samurai and revenge story;)

A + !!",0.407013888888889
afro samurai,"I love the art direction and style of the anime and the whole concept of a black man who wields a samurai ventures through Japan.
My only gripe is the main character Afro Samurai himself, I couldn't find him likeable or have a reason to root for him. I just saw him a selfish, blood thirsty and lost soul who wants nothing but revenge, even though it doesn't guarantee him peace. I'm probably missing something about the anime and the protagonist but I guess some of you fans could enlighten me.",0.024999999999999994

vinland saga,"Vinland Saga is the best Netflix series you've probably never heard of. Admittedly I came for the animation, but stayed for the tears. NEVER has anime moved me the way this show did; and on reflection, my emotional reaction to the series only once before occurred in a series you might  have heard of—Game of Thrones. But that was a story featuring living, breathing actors, based on a collection of books written by the incomparable George RR Martin. Like in Martin's tale, the characters in Vinland are fleshed out in such a way that though they are not real, though they are mere moving images drawn both by hand and computer, eventually your brain forgets that, and suddenly its protagonist Thorfinn becomes as real as Kit Harrington's Jon Snow, as real as his father Thors becomes as real as Snow's ""father,"" Sean Bean's Eddard Stark. A remarkable feat that will stay with me until my last breath. I am eagerly awaiting season 2, which reportedly will be released January 2023.",0.13928571428571426

black lagoon,"I like how you mention Evangelion. Black Lagoon is a very good show, Eva has its own cult following- surprised they never made an American movie for Eva, but they'd likely mess it up like with Dragonball. One Piece is a good live adaptation though. Netflix's Cowboy Bebop was a failure in my eyes that made me appreciate the original series more.",0.20484848484848486

black lagoon,"The reason so many anime stories revolve around the period of time that is High School is actually for the exact same reason they keep transporting Peter Parker back into that age whenever they reboot or spin-off Spider-Man:  it's a period of time that literally EVERY SINGLE VIEWER is going to have in common.  It's the most universal of experiences.  Is your character an effed-up adult mercenary?  Who's going to like that person?  You'll end up liking them if you end up liking them, but you won't have anything in common with them to help bridge that gap.  I mean, hell, the way they made you forgive John Wick for murdering hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people while saying less than 40 words over the course of a 4-movie franchise (well, 5 if you include Ballerina) is that they gave him a pet... people love and identify with pets.  People identify easily with High School.

Oh, also, Japan doesn't really have ""creative"" things.  I'm not trying to be controversial, I'm just saying everything is far more corporatized and owned than people seem to realize.  You're favorite J-Pop/J-Metal/J-Rock band was 100%, no questions asked, do not at me, built by committee.  Your favorite manga?  Guarantee it passed through 3 or 4 editors who gave ""this is non-negotiable"" edits to those stories and characters.  Things like manga and music and anime are PRODUCTS meant to generate money, period.  If you like them?  Then cool.  There were creatives who were very passionate and proud that - of all the works that got looked at by teams upon teams of editors - that THEIR creative thing got picked.  That one part of your favorite series that makes absolutely no sense to the entire fanbase and pisses them off and flies in the face of everything the creator said?  Yeah, probably from the editors and money-men.  Not a joke.  Not an exaggeration.  The Black Zetsu in Naruto being some last-second ""But really, I was responsible for everything, and the real villain isn't Madara, the guy we've built up for most of the series!  It's this rando over here""?  That part?  Yeah, they were doing a sequel whether Kishimoto was in or not.  So then they told him ""you have to bridge your series with what we're already planning on doing.""  Ta-da!  Momoshiki!  Out of fucking NOWHERE!  Hope you all enjoy!  Oh, did this author just pitch a series that involves an adult character going on an adventure in this world with a younger action-oriented protagonist?  Nope!!  She's getting aged down to a teen girl!  So all the boys can like her!  And we're putting her in short-shorts/a skirt for good measure!  Oh, you thought your drama, slice-of-life series was going to be about adult friends who are struggling with life as young adults, and one of them becomes so depressed they walk out in front of a car?  NOPE!  You instead get HIGH SCHOOLERS who do basically this exact same thing, but oddly act and feel like adults, with the caveat being ""their in their senior year, so they're more mature!""  (that's the series Orange if you didn't pick up on it).  Why?  Because Shonen makes money.  Because Shonen makes the MOST money.  Because Shonen makes the most money when the characters are young and have to go to some kind of school.

Hell, even Harry Potter is just ""an anime about kids going to magic school - it ends when they graduate after defeating the evil main villain"".  Spider-Man turned into an adult, and they decided NOT to morph Peter back into a teen?  Bring out Miles!  Who's a teen!  Oh, we're letting Miles age up?  Bring out a new version of Gwen Stacey!  She's a Spider-Woman now!  And a teen!  Oh, is she aging out now?  Better make up some wild shit about her getting merged into the standard Marvel universe and get aged down AGAIN!  Naruto became an adult?  End it!  It's now about his teen son!  Bleach reached it's climax and the main characters can now become adults?  Nope!  Hint off at their kids being new protagonists!  Fullmetal Alchemist has Edward as an adult?  End it, quick!  Even Attack on Titan ends with the characters BARELY being adults!  This is just... the DUMBEST form of media, but it's also the most popular, so... you take it with it's flaws, or you don't.",0.16535820819805191

made in abyss,"As someone who's been tortured in my life and have smelled the stench of burning human flesh, I can tell you with certainty that this anime delves deeper into the exploration of the intimacy of inflicting suffering than anything I've ever seen before. This show is mostly horror but it devotes a significant portion of time to people doing bad things to other people. There are three kinds of torturers. There's the professional who does it for god and country. There is the sadist who does it for the sheer sexual ecstasy of it. And then there's the intimate torturer who does it for the human connection it gives them. This show shows the latter in at least once instance. It's pretty sick and twisted but also rather enlightening. To this day I can't tell you what I think of the show. For one, the author loves to indulge in the display of bodily functions as well as various taboos. I suspect he/she rates rather high on the dark triad.

made in abyss,"As someone who's been tortured in my life and have smelled the stench of burning human flesh, I can tell you with certainty that this anime delves deeper into the exploration of the intimacy of inflicting suffering than anything I've ever seen before. This show is mostly horror but it devotes a significant portion of time to people doing bad things to other people. There are three kinds of torturers. There's the professional who does it for god and country. There is the sadist who does it for the sheer sexual ecstasy of it. And then there's the intimate torturer who does it for the human connection it gives them. This show shows the latter in at least once instance. It's pretty sick and twisted but also rather enlightening. To this day I can't tell you what I think of the show. For one, the author loves to indulge in the display of bodily functions as well as various taboos. I suspect he/she rates rather high on the dark triad. But I can also see a lot of humanity in the anime so in the end, hell if I know.",-0.005214285714285713

The emotions of the characters were just so real and raw. Absolutely amazing how they get us to care so much about who wins a video game battle. It could be based on their love for another character or a character's self-esteem, or their general psychological health. They always manage to put serious stakes on the outcome of video game battles that left me having to know who wins.
Even with the massive amount of choice on Netflix and other streaming services, I watched this all the way through. Absolutely loved it. Thank you to the creator.",0.09337606837606838

Of course you most likely don't buy manga as it serializes in Japan, so i don't know if you actually care about the sale #s of shonen jump. But it does determine a lot at the series level. 

The three things that have been most damaging to World Triggers success are Toei, The Writer's Health (as it limits the amount of content that can be put out), and lastly the content. For example, right now in the manga a character Hyuse battles several Border agents that are fairly formidable; he beats them in varying degrees 5 to 1, 5 to 0, 5 to 4; but you never see the fights just the scores of the combat simulation. Then another thing is they start story lines that they may never finish like one squad is on the verge of falling apart and they get 3 or 4 chapters of story and then just vanish. They detail this huge world, and make it so immersive, but as it is just a manga you can't always get the information that you want.",0.21473214285714284

fruits basket,"Fruits basket was the first manga I've ever read and I was super young when I read it. There was parts I didn't understand fully but I felt. The scene where kyo's dad holds him up in the air and says ""From now on, you'll have to breathe the air of higher places."" I grew up with a single parent household and reading that made something click in my brain. A deep feeling of understanding of my mom and why she worked so hard for my brother and I. This manga has shaped me as a person and my understanding of love. It taught me that love is complex but beautiful. It comes in all shapes and sizes. All colors and ways. It taught me that change is ok. Change is natural and scary. But good. Even when you have bad change. Even if you lose something or someone you love, even when it feels like there is no hope and that nothing will get better. Even in our darkest moments its ok. You'll be ok. It taught me that everything ends eventually. And that's such a scary thought but that's what makes it beautiful. If everything was forever then we wouldn't understand how beautiful and precious life is. We wouldn't understand the space and magnitude that the people we love hold in our hearts and mind.  I have a space on my shelf of this story, the whole collection, and it'll remain there until it gets passed on.

one punch man," @lastmortal8336 season 4 seems a little impossible, considering that they were able to slightly save season 2 within an inch of its life. Not because it wasn’t the same level as season 1 but because it’s didn’t adapt very important and didn’t have incredibly bad animation, the animation itself was actually decent and made it favourably. However that season 2 were solely Jc Staff working normally at the show, which is also why danmachi season 2 didn’t come till 2019 because of Opm season 2. And this was close because it’s was normally animated and they were given time, not a lot but still enough to deliver somewhat good quality. 

Season 3 was just a way of making money off of little budget and minimum effort, without any time at all. So the reason why season 3 is horrible is not because of Jc Staff, But Bandai, the same corporations at the top of Jc Staff leading the anime to be as horrible and bad. Minimum risk big reward as it adapts a very popular manga.


Main point is, It’s genuinely not Jc Staff’s fault. That’s all",-0.0534090909090909

goblin slayer,"I finished watching season 2 a day ago and I have to say... ...I think I'll just stick with the first season, the paladin movie was okay even if it felt like three episodes crammed into one, season 2 on the other hand felt a tiny bit... ""meh"". This season just didn't quite have the same impact as the first, there were still some blood and gore (mostly on the goblins) and some graphic images, the only stuff like that stood out the most was in the first four episode ark with that young wizard brat while the rest of the season started to focus a little more on the slice of life elements ...and... bits of fanservice no less (6 & 10). I did like first ark of season 2 like when we learn more about who that wizard kid really is which helps give more depth to Goblin Slayer and Priestess who's courage and strength begins to grow more and more as she ends up gaining a silver rank in the end of the ark. So yeah not give anything else away but in my opinion the first ark and the final ark with a princess rescue mission were the only parts of Season 2 I thought were good, the middle of it was just okay. Overall I didn't think Season 2 was good as Season 1 but definitely not at all worst, I'm just hoping it might get a little better in the third season if they'll ever make one in the six years. But what do you guys think?",0.16380952380952385

Bakemonogatari has a certain style that not everyone may like; it's surrealistic and weird, but the series is nonetheless amazing. It truly depends on what you watch and what you read. If you don't like anime, it wouldn't surprise me if you still like the Monogatari series. I have never given any sort of fiction a 10/10, but Bakemonogatari is an 8.25/10, and the Monogatari series overall would be a 9/10. It's a hot mess; self-indulgent and witty, but try it.

Be prepared, though, for an oddly melancholy story that stands in contrast to the super deformed chibi art.  I give it a rating of “A-“.

Chisato is a great my main character, don't get me wrong. I understand her reason for refusing to kill despite being trained as an Assassin since childhood (and it wasn't her fault that she has the natural talent to be one). I love her chemistry with Takina and her (somewhat) mutual respect for Majima, they really handle it really well. I also love how they handled her when the truth finally came out to her.

But not killing her in the final episode  kind of ruined...basically all the build up they prepared themselves for the climax. Like, what was the point of giving Chisato all those problems regarding her heart if the story will end up with happy ending anyway? Chisato herself wanted her friends to move on even after her death (She even wanted Mika to keep the cafe open after her death, Takina to continue her duty as Lycoris, Mizuko to keep looking out for lover). It would be a quite bittersweet ending for them to do that. But no, the author decided to go with ""Everyone's alive route"", ignoring everything that they laid in the previous episode.

It's still a good anime due to Chisato carrying the series on her back, but the plot makes me put this anime into the ""not worth rewatching"" list, once is enough no matter how much I love Chisato.",0.1864583333333334

attack on titan,The first trailer I ever seen or heard of this show was on cartoon network toonami.  Greatest random blind moment ever. The fact that I was into zombies made me wanna watch it.,0.0625
attack on titan,"okay so my expectations for this season from this trailer of someone who knows absolutely nothing:

Something has caused these giant human like Gods to rise up that at first just seem harmless and just ominous but then start forming danger as they show they're no gentle giants but monsters. There is this highly specialized group of hunters that team up to protect the people from these things. But they find out they're quite smart and more dangerous than they have ever had to deal with. They lose some of their people. They try to find out where they came from. Maybe there is a greater darker hidden figure behind them, controlling or creating them.

i think the younger boy/man is the main character and goes on this cool character growth journey where he starts of in deep fear and helplessness until he finds his strength but also great loss (either someone dies, he makes a grave mistake which he feels guilty about, or he loses his sanity or humanity)",0.07871428571428568

attack on titan,"I have good news for you. Watching it again, you'll notice details you missed on the first view. But did you know it goes even deeper than that? Think about an iceberg meme, there's the surface level, below the surface level, but there's also a BASEMENT level at the very bottoms of the ocean floor. What lies beyond the surface of the ocean, in the basement of the ocean floor? Why did Armin hold up a murex shell to Eren when they reached the sea? Is the murex shell used to make a psychedelic drug in ancient Phoenicia called the ""burning purple"" or the Phoenix? Why does Armin burn to death only to be born again? Why do wise old men have missing eyes or blindness in fairy tales? Why do Eren and Hanji lose their eyes? Doesn't Hanji also burn to death, and Eren in Season 1 dies and is reborn? Why did the church of the walls cover up the outside world? Why does King Fritz always look bored and out of it? Why did Ymir get titan powers when she fell into a pool of water beneath a tree and connected with a symbiote worm? Do certain trees have roots whose bark releases chemicals like dimethyltriptamine (DMT)? How is Ayahuasca prepared? Can microbes, worms, snakes, and reptiles adapt to poisonous habitats by gaining an immunity to poison through chronic micro-dosing? Did the Hallucigenia that attached to Ymir gain its powers because the tree it lived under had bark that contained DMT like acacia or mimosa root bark, which was effectively brewed into ayahuasca in the pool of murky water beneath/inside the hollow tree which Ymir fell into after being shot with an arrow? Is the main theme of Attack on Titan, ""Crimson Bow and Arrow""? What is the Old English (Anglo-Saxon) word for ""arrowhead"" or ""spearhead""? What is the etymology of the word, ""God""? Did Germanic tribes dominate their continent through the use of poison tipped arrows? Did ancient Teutons have a special military unit called a berserker or a titan who fought naked? What is the origin of this symbol -> ✝ or this symbol ->⚕ or this symbol ->💘? Is Eren considered a ""gadfly"" and what is the origin of the word ""gad""? Why did the serpent in the Garden of Eden tell Eve to eat the forbidden fruit to open her eyes? Is the forbidden fruit the fruit of her loins? What is fetal alcohol syndrome? What is auto-brewery syndrome? Is there such a thing as fetal psychedelic exposure syndrome? Is there such a thing as endogenous psychedelic overproduction syndrome? Did ancient tribes use psychedelic drugs made from snake venom to abort unwanted pregnancies? Did Eve eat her own abortion to gain enlightenment? Is this the true reason why God punishes her with ""giving birth in pain"" since she no longer has access to the snakes or plants in the garden that make pain-killing medicine like opium which is made from poppy seeds? Why does Christa change her name to Historia? How come Eren, Mikasa, Armin, Levi, Historia, and Erwin are orphans? How come Sasha's father (the most emotionally mature character) runs an orphanage? What is the etymology of the word, ""orphan""? Does it have anything to do with the Orphic snake mysteries from ancient Greece? Is Orpheus credited with inventing a genre of literature based on substance abuse? Is the suffering and death of the god Dionysus and the hands of Titans the central myth of Orphism? Is Eren Yeager's death inspired by Dionysus? Is Jesus Christ's death inspired by Dionysus?

I love everything about it: The ideologies; the internal and external conflicts; the themes of hatred, freedom, trauma, redemption, sacrifice, survival, human nature and identity crisis… Among many more. Particularly Eren’s journey was probably the most tragic and impactful thing I’ve experienced. His dynamics, parallels, morality, complexity, symbolism, determination, reasons, will, consistency, worldview, dialogues, monologues, layers and his characterization in general is almost unmatched for me. I don’t think I’ll ever get to experience such a thought-provoking journey ever again. And there is so much more to it than Eren’s journey. There is a full cast of incredible characters with their own strengths and developments… There is also an outstanding world building, amazing confrontations, many character peaks, insane plot twists and more.",0.29466666666666663

attack on titan,The first trailer I ever seen or heard of this show was on cartoon network toonami.  Greatest random blind moment ever. The fact that I was into zombies made me wanna watch it.,0.0625
attack on titan,"okay so my expectations for this season from this trailer of someone who knows absolutely nothing:

Something has caused these giant human like Gods to rise up that at first just seem harmless and just ominous but then start forming danger as they show they're no gentle giants but monsters. There is this highly specialized group of hunters that team up to protect the people from these things. But they find out they're quite smart and more dangerous than they have ever had to deal with. They lose some of their people. They try to find out where they came from. Maybe there is a greater darker hidden figure behind them, controlling or creating them.

i think the younger boy/man is the main character and goes on this cool character growth journey where he starts of in deep fear and helplessness until he finds his strength but also great loss (either someone dies, he makes a grave mistake which he feels guilty about, or he loses his sanity or humanity)",0.07871428571428568

Think about an iceberg meme, there's the surface level, below the surface level, but there's also a BASEMENT level at the very bottoms of the ocean floor. What lies beyond the surface of the ocean, in the basement of the ocean floor? Why did Armin hold up a murex shell to Eren when they reached the sea? Is the murex shell used to make a psychedelic drug in ancient Phoenicia called the ""burning purple"" or the Phoenix? Why does Armin burn to death only to be born again? Why do wise old men have missing eyes or blindness in fairy tales? Why do Eren and Hanji lose their eyes? Doesn't Hanji also burn to death, and Eren in Season 1 dies and is reborn?

Why did Ymir get titan powers when she fell into a pool of water beneath a tree and connected with a symbiote worm? Do certain trees have roots whose bark releases chemicals like dimethyltriptamine (DMT)? How is Ayahuasca prepared? Can microbes, worms, snakes, and reptiles adapt to poisonous habitats by gaining an immunity to poison through chronic micro-dosing? Did the Hallucigenia that attached to Ymir gain its powers because the tree it lived under had bark that contained DMT like acacia or mimosa root bark, which was effectively brewed into ayahuasca in the pool of murky water beneath/inside the hollow tree which Ymir fell into after being shot with an arrow?

Why did the serpent in the Garden of Eden tell Eve to eat the forbidden fruit to open her eyes? Is the forbidden fruit the fruit of her loins? What is fetal alcohol syndrome? What is auto-brewery syndrome? Is there such a thing as fetal psychedelic exposure syndrome? Is there such a thing as endogenous psychedelic overproduction syndrome? Did ancient tribes use psychedelic drugs made from snake venom to abort unwanted pregnancies? Did Eve eat her own abortion to gain enlightenment? Is this the true reason why God punishes her with ""giving birth in pain"" since she no longer has access to the snakes or plants in the garden that make pain-killing medicine like opium which is made from poppy seeds? Why does Christa change her name to Historia? How come Eren, Mikasa, Armin, Levi, Historia, and Erwin are orphans? How come Sasha's father (the most emotionally mature character) runs an orphanage? What is the etymology of the word, ""orphan""? Does it have anything to do with the Orphic snake mysteries from ancient Greece?

私たちは「進撃の巨人」の大ファンです。物語の終わり方には満足していますが、物語が何らかの形で続くと嬉しく思います。
一つのアイデアを共有させてください。ミカサの選択に感動したユミルが、何か手がかりを残したかもしれません。それをアルミンが発見し、エレンが新しい形で復活するような展開があるかもしれません。タイタンの力に関する新しい謎が生まれ、新たな旅が始まることを想像しています。
この素晴らしい作品を本当にありがとうございました。

Dear Isayama-sensei,
We are big fans of Attack on Titan. We truly respect how the story ended, and we’re not disappointed, but we would be very happy if the story continued in some form.
We'd like to share a small idea: Maybe Ymir, impressed by Mikasa’s choice, left some clues behind. Armin could discover them, leading to Eren returning in a new form—perhaps revealing new mysteries about the Titan powers and starting a new journey.
Thank you for creating such an incredible story.

zombie land saga,"The things I get from this trailer:
1. The certain bad things happen to both of Franchouchou, and Saga Prefecture itself.
2. A natural disaster happen on Saga. Judging by its damage it could be caused by an earthquake, tsunami, or a massive hurricane.
3. The audience are looks unhappy or bored with Franchouchou, you can see some of them are looking at their phones while the girls are still performing on the stage.
4. Franchouchou will have battle live concert against Iron Frill.
5. Tatsumi's plans are not going well.
6. The journalist guy try to doxx all of Franchouchou members real identity. But he only can reveal Ai, Lilly, and Junko true identity, the rest 4 still remain to be unknown because he didn't have any idea with them, since he never see them on local or national tv.
7. Ai, Lilly, and Junko true identity are revealed. And it become a big issue, and then spread into the nationwide that those 3 are getting revived in such a remote place like Saga.
8. Yuugiri's past will be revealed, but I still not sure about Tae.
9. Tae could be still remain as a zombie for almost of entire season 2. But maybe there's still a chance about she got her conscious back on the final quarter of this season  (eps. 10-12)
10. The timeline/chronology of this season is happened around the second quarter of 2019. FYI: first season timeline was set around the second-final quarter of 2018.
11. Tatsumi will tell to his zombie girls the reason why he choose, and how he bring them back from death.

zombie land saga,"Rewatched season 1 and i noticed smth.

>his necromancy is incomplete (tae is still acting like a zombie after all)
>he is very inexperienced in idol producing (he started in saga and always pushed the girls onto crowds with interests unrelated to idols. he always gets lucky that those crowds end up liking his idols)
>he lacks enough knowledge (he doesnt know all the details about Saga)
>he doesnt know how to talk properly with the girls thus resort back to his chuuni personality to get through them
>works tirelessly to make connections no matter how unrelated they are to idol groups in desperation of making his idols popular

Tatsumi here probably just forced himself to try and learn idol producing just so he can help Sakura achieve her dream when she was alive. He doesnt really have an interest on idols but he tries his best nonetheless out of the goodness of his heart or possible love for Sakura.

Sakura is probably the only girl that was kind to Tatsumi and the only one that called his name properly. And now he made it his life's mission to give her what she wanted despite already being dead.

BTW its possible that hes some sort of undead himself seeing that he has superhuman endurance and strength (that baseball hit deep bro. and the fact that he can kick down that barricade is saying enough. he doesnt have mental limits.)

And also, the point of this title sequel is from the character Shinta Okoba as the principal culprit and reason of why this band is going down because on the last episode of the first season, he noticed about the Franchouchou's members and the people they were in life.
Welp, and the idol band Iron Frill maybe a rival or bait to expose the idol zombies.

zombie land saga,"The things I get from this trailer:
1. The certain bad things happen to both of Franchouchou, and Saga Prefecture itself.
2. A natural disaster happen on Saga. Judging by its damage it could be caused by an earthquake, tsunami, or a massive hurricane.
3. The audience are looks unhappy or bored with Franchouchou, you can see some of them are looking at their phones while the girls are still performing on the stage.
4. Franchouchou will have battle live concert against Iron Frill.
5. Tatsumi's plans are not going well.
6. The journalist guy try to doxx all of Franchouchou members real identity. But he only can reveal Ai, Lilly, and Junko true identity, the rest 4 still remain to be unknown because he didn't have any idea with them, since he never see them on local or national tv.
7. Ai, Lilly, and Junko true identity are revealed. And it become a big issue, and then spread into the nationwide that those 3 are getting revived in such a remote place like Saga.
8. Yuugiri's past will be revealed, but I still not sure about Tae.
9. Tae could be still remain as a zombie for almost of entire season 2. But maybe there's still a chance about she got her conscious back on the final quarter of this season  (eps. 10-12)
10. The timeline/chronology of this season is happened around the second quarter of 2019. FYI: first season timeline was set around the second-final quarter of 2018.
11. Tatsumi will tell to his zombie girls the reason why he choose, and how he bring them back from death.

zombie land saga,"Rewatched season 1 and i noticed smth.

>his necromancy is incomplete (tae is still acting like a zombie after all)
>he is very inexperienced in idol producing (he started in saga and always pushed the girls onto crowds with interests unrelated to idols. he always gets lucky that those crowds end up liking his idols)
>he lacks enough knowledge (he doesnt know all the details about Saga)
>he doesnt know how to talk properly with the girls thus resort back to his chuuni personality to get through them
>works tirelessly to make connections no matter how unrelated they are to idol groups in desperation of making his idols popular

Tatsumi here probably just forced himself to try and learn idol producing just so he can help Sakura achieve her dream when she was alive. He doesnt really have an interest on idols but he tries his best nonetheless out of the goodness of his heart or possible love for Sakura.

Sakura is probably the only girl that was kind to Tatsumi and the only one that called his name properly. And now he made it his life's mission to give her what she wanted despite already being dead.

BTW its possible that hes some sort of undead himself seeing that he has superhuman endurance and strength (that baseball hit deep bro. and the fact that he can kick down that barricade is saying enough. he doesnt have mental limits.)

I hope they also make a potential season 3 and 4 after this movie so they can explore the girls's backstories and worldbuilding in greater depth given the two major flaws I have with this series is the fact that the pacing is inconsistent and that a lot of the characters and worldbuilding are underdeveloped due to the large ensemble of characters and limited 12 episodes per 2 seasons. I want to know things like the history of the girls's family's and more about the Saga curse. If this is the end of the series however, probably individual spin off series that cover the girls's past prior to their time becoming zombies would be a better alternative.",0.13695054945054944

plastic memories,"PLOT LEAK FOR SEASON 2 REVEALED:

Tsukasa has moved on with his life and has gotten technically savvy himself along with Michiru where they have both become scientists working for the betterment and improvement of Giftias.  As they work together, they find there's a way to increase the life-span of a Giftias from 9 years to 100 years.

During this research, Tsukasa and Michiru become closer.  Tsukasa is still hesitant to confess to Michiru as he fears it will interfere with their work. But Michiru has fallen head-over-heels for Tsukasa as she has observed how dedicated a man he is to both his work and in his relationships, particularly to Isla when she was still alive.
 
Then another major breakthrough discovery happens.  Tsukasa and Michiru discover that not only can they increase the life-span of a Giftia, but that it's possible to retain and transfer memories between an old Giftia at the end of its life-cycle to a new one, essentially making them immortal.  Tsukasa, realizing the implications of this, scrambles to dig through the digital archives of the lab to find all data retained for Isla.  In secret he manufacturers a physical replica of Isla.  In the meantime Michiru senses Tsukasa is up to something.

Late one night, when everyone has gone home and Tsukasa is alone, he begins to set up an attempt to transfer Isla's memories back into her new body.  Michiru suddenly appears as she was actually watching from the shadows, surprising Tsukasa.  An argument ensues and Tsukasa apologizes deeply to Michiru for being secretive as he didn't want Michiru to get in trouble as well if he was caught.  Michiru at first tells Tsukasa that such an experiment is reckless and dangerous and she wasn't going to allow it.  Michiru in her heart realizes that if Tsukasa's attempt is successful, it would most likely mean the end of her blossoming relationship with Tsukasa as she knows he still has strong feelings for Isla.  After Tsukasa explains the procedure is relatively safe and presses her for the real reason why she won't allow it, Michiru finally concedes for fear of her true feelings for Tsukasa being exposed and volunteers to stay and observe the transfer.  Even though Tsukasa told Michiru that the transfer should be relatively safe, he still feels a slight trepidation as he starts the process.

The memory transfer process begins.  Everything seems to be going well when suddenly an anomaly occurs that Michiru can only see on her computer screen.  She has it in her power to abort the memory transfer without Tsukasa knowing, making it look like a failure.  Instead tears well up in her eyes as she fixes the anomaly from her computer console without telling Tsukasa, allowing the transfer to complete.

Isla comes alive, begins to breath, and slowly opens her eyes.  Tsukasa is hesitant at first not sure if the transfer was entirely successful.  Isla then looks up, sees Tsukasa in front of her and then smiles thanking Tsukasa for the ferris wheel ride.  Tears well up in Tsukasa eyes as he is overwhelmed with joy.  He embraces Isla and they kiss. After a few moments of talking, Tsukasa remembers Michiru and turns to show Isla to her.  Michiru is gone.  He then sees something glowing on Michiru's monitor and walks over to it.  His eyes widen as the slow gentle flashes from her monitor reflect off his face as he realizes what she did. 

Michiru is walking outside away from the lab, almost stumbling, as she cries bitterly screaming out Tsukasa's name over and over.

1. Anime one ( isla is retrieved ) 
2. Isla turns into wanderer
3. It's about Doctor yu ( giftias system inventor I believe ) which puts isla into deep sleep as the doctor was making a program or something that endures / allows giftias to live forever ? very long or so. So she, Dr. yu, puts Isla into deep sleep for a bit and then when all's finished ( program ) she's being awaken to greet tsukasa. Ain't lying. She's alive, has her memories and all!

plastic memories,What i think would be best. If he again met her with her memories wiped and they became partners again. They would spend much time with eachother and would create “new” memories.

plastic memories,"PLOT LEAK FOR SEASON 2 REVEALED:

Tsukasa has moved on with his life and has gotten technically savvy himself along with Michiru where they have both become scientists working for the betterment and improvement of Giftias.  As they work together, they find there's a way to increase the life-span of a Giftias from 9 years to 100 years.

During this research, Tsukasa and Michiru become closer.  Tsukasa is still hesitant to confess to Michiru as he fears it will interfere with their work. But Michiru has fallen head-over-heels for Tsukasa as she has observed how dedicated a man he is to both his work and in his relationships, particularly to Isla when she was still alive.
 
Then another major breakthrough discovery happens.  Tsukasa and Michiru discover that not only can they increase the life-span of a Giftia, but that it's possible to retain and transfer memories between an old Giftia at the end of its life-cycle to a new one, essentially making them immortal.  Tsukasa, realizing the implications of this, scrambles to dig through the digital archives of the lab to find all data retained for Isla.  In secret he manufacturers a physical replica of Isla.  In the meantime Michiru senses Tsukasa is up to something.

Late one night, when everyone has gone home and Tsukasa is alone, he begins to set up an attempt to transfer Isla's memories back into her new body.  Michiru suddenly appears as she was actually watching from the shadows, surprising Tsukasa.  An argument ensues and Tsukasa apologizes deeply to Michiru for being secretive as he didn't want Michiru to get in trouble as well if he was caught.  Michiru at first tells Tsukasa that such an experiment is reckless and dangerous and she wasn't going to allow it.  Michiru in her heart realizes that if Tsukasa's attempt is successful, it would most likely mean the end of her blossoming relationship with Tsukasa as she knows he still has strong feelings for Isla.  After Tsukasa explains the procedure is relatively safe and presses her for the real reason why she won't allow it, Michiru finally concedes for fear of her true feelings for Tsukasa being exposed and volunteers to stay and observe the transfer.  Even though Tsukasa told Michiru that the transfer should be relatively safe, he still feels a slight trepidation as he starts the process.

The memory transfer process begins.  Everything seems to be going well when suddenly an anomaly occurs that Michiru can only see on her computer screen.  She has it in her power to abort the memory transfer without Tsukasa knowing, making it look like a failure.  Instead tears well up in her eyes as she fixes the anomaly from her computer console without telling Tsukasa, allowing the transfer to complete.

Isla comes alive, begins to breath, and slowly opens her eyes.  Tsukasa is hesitant at first not sure if the transfer was entirely successful.  Isla then looks up, sees Tsukasa in front of her and then smiles thanking Tsukasa for the ferris wheel ride.  Tears well up in Tsukasa eyes as he is overwhelmed with joy.  He embraces Isla and they kiss. After a few moments of talking, Tsukasa remembers Michiru and turns to show Isla to her.  Michiru is gone.  He then sees something glowing on Michiru's monitor and walks over to it.  His eyes widen as the slow gentle flashes from her monitor reflect off his face as he realizes what she did. 

Michiru is walking outside away from the lab, almost stumbling, as she cries bitterly screaming out Tsukasa's name over and over.

The theme , “ If we can’t uplift ourselves , even modern civilization will fall. ” remains unchanged.
SF settings are slightly shifted to religious ones , but it may increase the literary quality and cultural familiarity.
I was deeply moved to watch this 21st century , completed “ Devilman “ 💖.

What was wrong !?  Strong enemies ?  Technologies ?  Weapons ?  Policies ?  Social activities ?  
No , there were too little people who could keep humane mind when they gained superpower.
There were too many people who formed sects and killed each other , when they faced severe challenges 😭.

""SENSORY-FEELERS"" ARE LARGELY RESPONSIBLE FOR SPREADING DISINFORMATION AND HATE TOWARDS ENTJ/INTJ (AGAINST ""THINKERS"" IN GENERAL)—BOTH IRL AND ON THE INTERNET; DESPITE THOSE NEURO-PERSONALITY TYPES BEING A BLESSING TO SOCIETY AND ALL OF MANKIND! THEY DESERVE BETTER! 😤

'ESFJ', 'ESFP', ISFP and ISFJ are a pathogen to humanity, and 'then' Cluster-B (depending on they neuro-personality).

THEIR ""FEELINGS 'IS' THEIR REALITY"", THEY ALSO HAVE A MALICIOUS-MIND BY DEFAULT (excluding normal ISFJ). DESPITE HAVING MALICIOUS INTENT THEY ARE ALL EMOTIONALLY-WEAK AND PRONE TO COVERT/VULNERABLE-NARCISSISM.
...............................

Also... To intelligent readers (who do 'not’ have a ‘pathological disregard for rationality and reality').

I recommend researching 'narcissistic personality disorder' (NPD) / 'cluster-B'; and know that they are the 'root of all evil' (especially 'ESFJ/ESTJ-narcissist'; Myers-Briggs reference, look it up)!
European 'ESFJ' are the worst personality type, and they are responsible for inventing 'racism' and colonization! It is in their neuro-psychology!!!

They are extremely 'manipulative' and often use 'looking pretty' to distract others from the witch's mind-games / mind-r@pe, e.g. gaslighting, playing the victim/damsel in distress, creating ""flying-monkeys"", and 'bribing' others (with money or BJ) to attack, or at times, kill someone for her. When caught, she will use her minions as scapegoats. European ESFJ are notorious for this especially in a racist context, e.g. Emmett Till.

xSFP and ISFJ (2W1) are the most complicit, narcissistic-enablers. ISFP also tend to be 'oblivious-codependents' (look up the definition). Like ESFJ, XSFP's ""feelings 'is' their reality."" Most are covert/vulnerable-narcissists.

ISFJ often perceive things only on the surface level (even by sensor standards), are suckers for a “pretty face"", and their neuro-psychology makes them the ideal narcissitic-codependent and pawn to the ESFJ (blind-loyalty, surface level perception, susceptibility to covert-narcissism). Lastly, ISFJ are notorious for impersonating other people's identities IRL and on the internet.

SUMMARY

Evil personality: 'ESFJ' (ALL), ESTJ (Cluster-b), ISFJ-2W1 (covert-narc/enabler).

[Secretly] Evil and narcissist-friendly gunts/flying-monkey: ISFP (ALL), ESFP (ALL), and ISFJ (2W1 enable ESFJ).

☝️ALL of them are secretly emotionally-disturbed, hence their need to create conflict as a distraction (at other people's expense, truly evil).

Spread the word! Thank you.

sword art online,I remember watch SAO back in 2014 when my sister had introduced me into anime. SAO had been my favorite anime since and when I started watching alicization during Covid I got the feels back from this amazing anime and was lucky enough to experience the wait for alicization WoU Pt 2. I still miss SAOMD though and miss SAOARS(UB),0.2388888888888889

sword art online,"Plot Summary: In the year 2022, virtual reality has progressed by leaps and bounds, and a massive online role-playing game called Sword Art Online (SAO) is launched. With the aid of ""NerveGear"" technology, players can control their avatars within the game using nothing but their own thoughts. Kazuto Kirigaya, nicknamed ""Kirito,"" is among the lucky few enthusiasts who get their hands on the first shipment of the game. He logs in to find himself, with ten-thousand others, in the scenic and elaborate world of Aincrad, one full of fantastic medieval weapons and gruesome monsters. However, in a cruel turn of events, the players soon realize they cannot log out; the game's creator has trapped them in his new world until they complete all one hundred levels of the game. In order to escape Aincrad, Kirito will now have to interact and cooperate with his fellow players. Some are allies, while others are foes, like Asuna Yuuki, who commands the leading group attempting to escape from the ruthless game. To make matters worse, Sword Art Online is not all fun and games: if they die in Aincrad, they die in real life. Kirito must adapt to his new reality, fight for his survival, and hopefully break free from his virtual hell.",-0.09592074592074591

sword art online,"I watched SAO 2 before the first SAO because it was the only one on Netflix. I was tired of ads so I didn't use crunchyroll. I heard some good things about SAO so I started watching it. I watched it all under 24 hours. I got really connected to it and I even changed my entire PlayStation Network account to show that Simon (Shino Asada) was my favorite character. Right after I finished SAO 2 I felt empty. My life is boring all I do is watch YouTube videos, rewatch shows on Netflix and play video games. But SAO was something new. I loved it. 2 days go by after I watched SAO 2 I decide to watch the first SAO on crunchyroll. To my surprise there was an English dub version. I started watching it and like SAO 2, I finished it in less than 24 hours. That was at 6:43 PM today. Now I feel empty inside again. I can't stop thinking about SAO. I even cry thinking about SAO. I almost never cry about anything. I also tried watching SAO: Laicization but there's no English dub for it on crunchyroll so it wasn't the same.

And Overhaul was probably the only time where we see any kind of real anger with Izuku, even with that he still just punches him into unconsciousness. Even Dark Might just got put into a nap from what we see, despite Izuku's fury at the bastardized imitation of his mentor), then I'm pretty sure Izuku outspeeds Shigiraki and blows his head off.

As far as we've seen there isn't any speed quirks or such to counter gearshift overdrive, or even any perception quirks that would allow either Shigiraki or AFO to react and counter speeds faster than what the base human perception can take in much less faster than sound.

Edit: Also I'm confused about his gear breaking, I thought it acted like the one in Two Heroes where it broke if he did it at 100% 3 times? Or did it get changed for the battle?

persona animation,"Persona 5's anime adaptation was bogged down by various factors, but the most important was keeping Joker in it.
Joker is not a character, he represents the player, so Persona 5 Royal's anime adaptation, which has no player, needs to rewrite the plot so that it can be done by the actual characters and doesn't include the player himself.
Other shortcomings of the anime were caused by the team's trying to keep game mechanics in it even if they aren't appropriate to the anime medium.
How this anime adaptation needs to be done to be good:

1) Joker does not exist. Haru does. Joker's traits are split between Yusuke (he got transferred from Kosei to Shujin, he assaulted Shido and attempted to murder him, he's taken by Sojiro, he enters Kamoshida's Palace alongside Ryuji, he takes Morgana at Leblanc) and Makoto (she's the leader of the Phantom Thieves, she knows Goro was behind everything). Joker's design is taken by a nameless and non-speaking recurring cameo character at Shujin whom the PTs never actually interact with.

2) Kaneshiro's arc happens before Madarame: Makoto is met earlier to ""officially found"" the phantom thieves. Yusuke is already following Ryuji and Morgana in Kamoshida's Palace but is a noncombatant navigator/strategist until Madarame's arc.

3) Yusuke has a new character arc, having both Madarame and Shido as nemeses. Since he was raised by Madarame, he started developing a psychological complex that made him fanatically obsessed with beauty, art, nature and purity (and also being a Shinto fundamentalist), to the point of being a sociopath with ""those that do not appreciate true beauty"". After seeing Shido rape the woman, he willingly attempts to kill him, calling him ""an impure petty tyrant drunk with power, which only death can redeem"". He's taken by Sojiro not because he's innocent, but because Sojiro knows Yusuke has a mental disorder, and he wants to take in mentally disturbed people because he feels he has failed Futaba. His two palaces have him deal with both Madarame's abuse (Madarame) and Yusuke's own sociopathy (Shido).

4) The Velvet Room appears in dreams to Yusuke and Ryuji (and later to anyone who joins the PT). No mention is made of the Wild Card, as now Yusuke is Emperor and Goro is Justice (no one is Fool). Persona Fusion and Demon Negotiation simply do not exist at all, as they would be a blatant deus-ex-machina and a one-off mechanic that is never used after the first time: every character has a Persona tied to his/her personality, including Yusuke and Makoto. Instead, Ultimate Personas appear in the plot, and Yusuke and Makoto get theirs at the same time when fighting Shido. Satanael is a third-level Persona of Makoto created when Yusuke's Kamu Susanoo is fused with Anat. The Velvet Room is seen first-person, so Yusuke never talks to the twins.

5) Social Links are replaced by various bonding scenes where parts of the Social Links of two or more characters from the game are composed into one, and more character development is given to the characters. There are episodes completely focused on those scenes. Ultimate Personas are not always granted through Social Links (see Yusuke and Makoto) but Haru and Ann get theirs in a bonding scene with each other, and Futaba in one with Yusuke.

6) Ryuji dies for real after Shido's Palace collapses. Seiten Taisei is a boss in Maruki's arc, as the true form of a Shadow guardian in Maruki's Palace that looks identical to Ryuji (as the PTs' grief for Ryuji's death is used by Maruki as a ""wish he wants to grant to them""). A game can't have character deaths, but an anime can have them and they improve the story.

7) Makoto and Morgana travel to the TV station alone, rather than with Ann's class (but Ryuji and Ann follow them, while Yusuke stays home). There, Makoto and Goro start suspecting each other.

8) Maruki's arc is focused on Makoto, Goro and Kasumi. Yusuke loses focus until the Palace exploration, as he willingly goes to a psychiatric clinic for rehab (instead of a juvenile hall), then follows his game counterpart.

9) Persona fights are animated this way: the Persona stays out and damage to a persona is transmitted to the user (like Stands in JoJo). The protagonists have no weapon or gun in the real world but their Persona can transform into a weapon (a shotgun for Ryuji, a submachine gun for Ann, a katana for Yusuke, a slingshot for Morgana, a gun for Makoto, a sniper rifle for Futaba, an axe for Haru, a laser gun for Goro). Futaba's ultimate Persona Prometheus can fight, even though Necronomicon can't.

10) The title is not ""Persona 5 the Animation"", but ""An Emperor Among Phantom Thieves"", without the Persona name in it (because Persona game mechanics are taken off, it takes various liberties with the plot and it doesn't follow the game series's traditions).

11) Some characters are fully written off the plot, like Iwai (since there are no weapons), Ohya (already of minimal importance in the game), Chihaya (voice actor died and already of minimal importance in the game) and non-Yaldabaoth Igor (the voice actor died. Yaldabaoth has killed and replaced Igor, and he's replaced by Lavenza at the end, with Lavenza's fusion being actually caused by Igor's spirit). Other non-party SL are done by various party members, such as Ryuji that does Kawakami, Yusuke does Hifumi, etc. Some characters, like Caroline and Justine, exist but have their SL taken off (in the twins' case, it focuses on Fusion, which is a mechanic that cannot be adapted in Anime form).


12) Yusuke and Makoto do not receive the World Arcana. The World is Maruki's Arcana instead of the non-existing Councillor, while Kasumi is the Fool.

To those who want Joker to stay, why? 
Other than fanservice, what would Joker do if he stayed in the anime? Nothing that another character couldn't do by taking his few traits and incorporating them into his new characterization.
Remember that to make a good anime you sometimes need to take liberties from the source material. And completely writing off a silent and/or weakly characterized protagonist is the most important liberty to take, as it shows that the anime exist independent from the game and the player playing it

persona animation,"Persona 5's anime adaptation was bogged down by various factors, but the most important was keeping Joker in it.
Joker is not a character, he represents the player, so Persona 5 Royal's anime adaptation, which has no player, needs to rewrite the plot so that it can be done by the actual characters and doesn't include the player himself.
Other shortcomings of the anime were caused by the team's trying to keep game mechanics in it even if they aren't appropriate to the anime medium.
How this anime adaptation needs to be done to be good:

1) Joker does not exist. Haru does. Joker's traits are split between Yusuke (he got transferred from Kosei to Shujin, he assaulted Shido and attempted to murder him, he's taken by Sojiro, he enters Kamoshida's Palace alongside Ryuji, he takes Morgana at Leblanc) and Makoto (she's the leader of the Phantom Thieves, she knows Goro was behind everything). Joker's design is taken by a nameless and non-speaking recurring cameo character at Shujin whom the PTs never actually interact with.

2) Kaneshiro's arc happens before Madarame: Makoto is met earlier to ""officially found"" the phantom thieves. Yusuke is already following Ryuji and Morgana in Kamoshida's Palace but is a noncombatant navigator/strategist until Madarame's arc.

3) Yusuke has a new character arc, having both Madarame and Shido as nemeses. Since he was raised by Madarame, he started developing a psychological complex that made him fanatically obsessed with beauty, art, nature and purity (and also being a Shinto fundamentalist), to the point of being a sociopath with ""those that do not appreciate true beauty"". After seeing Shido rape the woman, he willingly attempts to kill him, calling him ""an impure petty tyrant drunk with power, which only death can redeem"". He's taken by Sojiro not because he's innocent, but because Sojiro knows Yusuke has a mental disorder, and he wants to take in mentally disturbed people because he feels he has failed Futaba. His two palaces have him deal with both Madarame's abuse (Madarame) and Yusuke's own sociopathy (Shido).

4) The Velvet Room appears in dreams to Yusuke and Ryuji (and later to anyone who joins the PT). No mention is made of the Wild Card, as now Yusuke is Emperor and Goro is Justice (no one is Fool). Persona Fusion and Demon Negotiation simply do not exist at all, as they would be a blatant deus-ex-machina and a one-off mechanic that is never used after the first time: every character has a Persona tied to his/her personality, including Yusuke and Makoto. Instead, Ultimate Personas appear in the plot, and Yusuke and Makoto get theirs at the same time when fighting Shido. Satanael is a third-level Persona of Makoto created when Yusuke's Kamu Susanoo is fused with Anat. The Velvet Room is seen first-person, so Yusuke never talks to the twins.

5) Social Links are replaced by various bonding scenes where parts of the Social Links of two or more characters from the game are composed into one, and more character development is given to the characters. There are episodes completely focused on those scenes. Ultimate Personas are not always granted through Social Links (see Yusuke and Makoto) but Haru and Ann get theirs in a bonding scene with each other, and Futaba in one with Yusuke.

6) Ryuji dies for real after Shido's Palace collapses. Seiten Taisei is a boss in Maruki's arc, as the true form of a Shadow guardian in Maruki's Palace that looks identical to Ryuji (as the PTs' grief for Ryuji's death is used by Maruki as a ""wish he wants to grant to them"").

7) Makoto and Morgana travel to the TV station alone, rather than with Ann's class (but Ryuji and Ann follow them, while Yusuke stays home). There, Makoto and Goro start suspecting each other.

8) Maruki's arc is focused on Makoto, Goro and Kasumi. Yusuke loses focus until the Palace exploration, as he willingly goes to a psychiatric clinic for rehab (instead of a juvenile hall), then follows his game counterpart.

9) Persona fights are animated this way: the Persona stays out and damage to a persona is transmitted to the user (like Stands in JoJo). The protagonists have no weapon or gun in the real world but their Persona can transform into a weapon (a shotgun for Ryuji, a submachine gun for Ann, a katana for Yusuke, a slingshot for Morgana, a gun for Makoto, a sniper rifle for Futaba, an axe for Haru, a laser gun for Goro). Futaba's ultimate Persona Prometheus can fight, even though Necronomicon can't.

10) The title is not ""Persona 5 the Animation"", but ""An Emperor Among Phantom Thieves"", without the Persona name in it (because Persona game mechanics are taken off, it takes various liberties with the plot and it doesn't follow the game series's traditions).

11) Some characters are fully written off the plot, like Iwai (since there are no weapons), Ohya (already of minimal importance in the game), Chihaya (voice actor died and already of minimal importance in the game) and non-Yaldabaoth Igor (the voice actor died.

violet evergarden,"What makes Violet Evergarden so special to me — what makes it truly unforgettable — is the love story between Gilbert and Violet. It’s not your typical romance. It’s not built on passion or grand gestures. It’s Platonic in its purity, yet undeniably romantic in its quiet intensity.

Their bond is what moved me the most.
I resonate with Violet — her innocence, her longing, her loyalty. But you also feel Gilbert. You feel his guilt, his conflict, his quiet and steady heart burdened by a love that’s both too much and never enough. He loves her — probably more than anyone else ever could — but instead of embracing it, he chooses to walk away. Not because he doesn’t care. Because he cares too much.

Gilbert deeply loves Violet, but he never tries to control her. He’s afraid of the imbalance in their relationship — afraid that her love stems from dependency, not understanding. That fear, combined with the weight of societal expectations and his own guilt, leads him to step away. Not out of rejection, but out of moral strength. And that’s what makes it both beautiful and tragic.

He sees her as someone too young, emotionally and mentally — a blank slate shaped by war. He fears her feelings were born from trauma, not true emotional maturity. To accept her love would feel, to him, like taking advantage of her innocence. Society would say:

“She’s too naive. He’s the adult. It’s wrong. He should know better.”

So he tells himself:

“Even if I love her back… I must protect her. Even from me.”

And that’s the heartbreaking part.

He doesn’t reject her — he sacrifices his own happiness, choosing to protect her from what he sees as his own shadow.
Just watching Gilbert is painful. You can feel what he feels. The terrible burden of being loved so deeply by someone who doesn’t yet fully understand the world — and choosing pain over joy to shield them.

I deeply respect Gilbert for this. He is honorable and selfless in a way that feels almost unreachable. I wish I could be like him — but I don’t think I could bear that kind of pain. If I were in his place, I would have accepted Violet’s love. Yes, even knowing how innocent and dependent she is. But I’d help her grow. I’d be honest with her, guide her, and let her choose for herself when she’s older — whether to stay, or move on.

Gilbert doesn’t do this because he’s weak — but because he’s strong in a different, more tragic way. He becomes the embodiment of selflessness.
He sacrifices his own happiness. He does what’s “right,” even if it breaks both of their hearts. He protects her, even when it means losing her.

Some people interpret their bond as father-daughter — that Gilbert was a guardian, not a romantic figure. That he was merely there to guide Violet, help her grow, and then disappear so she could become her own person. And sure, that interpretation exists. It focuses on:The age and power gap, Violet’s emotional immaturity, and Gilbert’s guilt as the reason he walks away.

But the truth is that’s not the whole story. The anime and the light novels make it very clear — this is not just a parental bond. Violet’s love is romantic. She doesn’t vaguely say “I love you” — she yearns for him.

Gilbert’s silence is not because he sees her as a child — it’s because he doesn’t believe he deserves her love. His absence isn’t an act of guardianship. It’s a self-imposed exile — driven by shame, not detachment.

And as the Violet Evergarden Gaiden and the final movie show us, their feelings are mutual. Violet grows. She learns. She becomes someone who chooses to love — not because she was trained to, but because she wants to. She discovers that Gilbert is alive, living in isolation on a remote island, teaching children — ashamed of his past and convinced he’s unworthy of her.

But she finds him.
She confronts him. She cries. She tells him:

“I love you.”
“I’m not a tool. I’m Violet Evergarden.”

This moment — this declaration — is everything. It’s not a child’s plea. It’s a grown woman making a choice.
Gilbert, once again, tries to resist. He tells her she deserves more. That she should move on. But she refuses. She tells him she wants to build a life with him. That her love isn’t naive anymore — it’s mature, intentional, real.

And finally… he accepts it.

The movie ends with them walking hand-in-hand into the future, on that same island. It’s not a dramatic, showy reunion. It’s quiet. Gentle. Deeply emotional. Just like them.

Kana Akatsuki (the original author) and Kyoto Animation both leaned into this as a romantic conclusion. In interviews, the director even said: 

“We chose not to show a kiss scene because Violet’s emotions are more than physical. The point was not to show romance, but to show connection.”

Their love is a connection that runs deeper than labels, deeper than age, and deeper than words. Violet is no longer a girl. She’s someone who understands who she is. And Gilbert finally lets go of the guilt, opening his heart and allowing himself to love — and be loved — without fear.

Their love story is not ordinary. It’s not explosive. It’s quiet. But it’s also one of the most emotionally powerful, morally complex, and deeply moving love stories I’ve ever seen in my life. I hope you can understand.",0.18015910102358693

If you watch the movie in isolation, you probably wouldn't have the same feeling, but having seen Violet's growth throughout the years, and seeing her resolution in the last episode of the series, you understand it is likely and even beautiful in its own way if Violet had truly went her own way instead of being with Gilbert. The fact that Violet DID walk away first solidified it. Yet, as a last bit of fantastical magic left in this age that is slowly shifting toward modern technology, her heartfelt wish was answered.

violet evergarden,"What makes Violet Evergarden so special to me — what makes it truly unforgettable — is the love story between Gilbert and Violet. It’s not your typical romance. It’s not built on passion or grand gestures. It’s Platonic in its purity, yet undeniably romantic in its quiet intensity.

Their bond is what moved me the most.
I resonate with Violet — her innocence, her longing, her loyalty. But you also feel Gilbert. You feel his guilt, his conflict, his quiet and steady heart burdened by a love that’s both too much and never enough. He loves her — probably more than anyone else ever could — but instead of embracing it, he chooses to walk away. Not because he doesn’t care. Because he cares too much.

Gilbert deeply loves Violet, but he never tries to control her. He’s afraid of the imbalance in their relationship — afraid that her love stems from dependency, not understanding. That fear, combined with the weight of societal expectations and his own guilt, leads him to step away. Not out of rejection, but out of moral strength. And that’s what makes it both beautiful and tragic.

He sees her as someone too young, emotionally and mentally — a blank slate shaped by war. He fears her feelings were born from trauma, not true emotional maturity. To accept her love would feel, to him, like taking advantage of her innocence. Society would say:

“She’s too naive. He’s the adult. It’s wrong. He should know better.”

So he tells himself:

“Even if I love her back… I must protect her. Even from me.”

And that’s the heartbreaking part.

He doesn’t reject her — he sacrifices his own happiness, choosing to protect her from what he sees as his own shadow.
Just watching Gilbert is painful. You can feel what he feels. The terrible burden of being loved so deeply by someone who doesn’t yet fully understand the world — and choosing pain over joy to shield them.

I deeply respect Gilbert for this. He is honorable and selfless in a way that feels almost unreachable. I wish I could be like him — but I don’t think I could bear that kind of pain. If I were in his place, I would have accepted Violet’s love. Yes, even knowing how innocent and dependent she is. But I’d help her grow. I’d be honest with her, guide her, and let her choose for herself when she’s older — whether to stay, or move on.

Gilbert doesn’t do this because he’s weak — but because he’s strong in a different, more tragic way. He becomes the embodiment of selflessness.
He sacrifices his own happiness. He does what’s “right,” even if it breaks both of their hearts. He protects her, even when it means losing her.

Some people interpret their bond as father-daughter — that Gilbert was a guardian, not a romantic figure. That he was merely there to guide Violet, help her grow, and then disappear so she could become her own person. And sure, that interpretation exists. It focuses on:The age and power gap, Violet’s emotional immaturity, and Gilbert’s guilt as the reason he walks away.

But the truth is that’s not the whole story. The anime and the light novels make it very clear — this is not just a parental bond. Violet’s love is romantic. She doesn’t vaguely say “I love you” — she yearns for him.

Gilbert’s silence is not because he sees her as a child — it’s because he doesn’t believe he deserves her love. His absence isn’t an act of guardianship. It’s a self-imposed exile — driven by shame, not detachment.

And as the Violet Evergarden Gaiden and the final movie show us, their feelings are mutual. Violet grows. She learns. She becomes someone who chooses to love — not because she was trained to, but because she wants to. She discovers that Gilbert is alive, living in isolation on a remote island, teaching children — ashamed of his past and convinced he’s unworthy of her.

But she finds him.
She confronts him. She cries. She tells him:

“I love you.”
“I’m not a tool. I’m Violet Evergarden.”

This moment — this declaration — is everything. It’s not a child’s plea. It’s a grown woman making a choice.
Gilbert, once again, tries to resist. He tells her she deserves more. That she should move on. But she refuses. She tells him she wants to build a life with him. That her love isn’t naive anymore — it’s mature, intentional, real.

And finally… he accepts it.

The movie ends with them walking hand-in-hand into the future, on that same island. It’s not a dramatic, showy reunion. It’s quiet. Gentle. Deeply emotional. Just like them.

Kana Akatsuki (the original author) and Kyoto Animation both leaned into this as a romantic conclusion. In interviews, the director even said: 

“We chose not to show a kiss scene because Violet’s emotions are more than physical. The point was not to show romance, but to show connection.”

Their love is a connection that runs deeper than labels, deeper than age, and deeper than words. Violet is no longer a girl. She’s someone who understands who she is. And Gilbert finally lets go of the guilt, opening his heart and allowing himself to love — and be loved — without fear.

Their love story is not ordinary. It’s not explosive. It’s quiet. But it’s also one of the most emotionally powerful, morally complex, and deeply moving love stories I’ve ever seen in my life. I hope you can understand.",0.18015910102358693

your lie in april,"Dear A – 1 picture and Mr. Naoshi Arakawa
Over this week, I watched the Your lie in April for the first time and I could get my mind out of the Sad ending, which Kaori did not pass the surgery. The ending is beautiful and emotional but it was hurt every time I watched it again. Kaori rises Kousei rescue him from the past, she gave him hope and another chance to play the piano. Despite the fact she had been sick for a long time and could not live any longer but she still tries to save Kousei live. 
I read a lot of Happy ending on Wattpad and it raise my feeling a little bit but there is something still hurt my mind likes Kousei will be left alone again with his feelings just like my childhood, which makes me have a courage to do this. I am begging A -1 pictures and Mr. Naoshi Arakawa, please make a Happy ending for both Arima Kousei and Miyanoro Kaori. I always imaged Kousei walk into the hospital after the performance and see Kaori resting after her success surgery and after that maybe they can marry or even have kids. And I know it is hard and take time, money and efforts.
But those two should live happy after all like Kousei talked in episode 8 Light of life: “I am going on a journey. Searching for that moment. When my music reaches someone amides wild applause. Search for that image of you. Until one day when we can walk together shoulder to shoulder.” This anime saved me from a lonely boy loves Oreo have issues in trust people and usually alone to a boy think that I should try to trust people more and enjoy every moment in life. I wish I had a friend like Kaori. 
I am sorry for the long letter. Thank you for reading all of this. I do not have email of Mr. Naoshi Arakawa, which I wish I had and could to him more, so I have to send in this. Please give me hope like Miyazono Kaori did.
Thank you.

your lie in april,"(Spoilers Review)
I just finished my marathon of this show, it took 2 days to watch 22 episodes. So, there I was late at night looking for my next Anime to watch, when I stumbled across “Your Lie in April” all the comments were giving out great reviews on it, so I decided to give it a go. And I have to say, it was good. I enjoyed it very much, the characters, the plot and the music were all good. But I must be honest in my review, and I think this show is a little bit overrated, and in fact there are some things about this show that I really didn’t like. Just because the plot of this Anime is tragic, and one of your main characters is going to die at the end, does not automatically mean it’s a masterpiece of an Anime. Just because the girl dying is the cliché “free spirit” character who teachers the broken boy how to feel again, does not mean it’s destined to make you cry. I honestly tried to let myself get lost in this Anime, so I could feel it better, and some part of me did. But I was never fully into it. And I think what gets me the most is just how unsatisfying it was, like seriously, very unsatisfying. For being a love story, this Anime has zero romance, there is no kissing, hugging or any physical interaction at all (besides piggybacks) and even verbally there is not much to go on. Kaori is clearly in love with Kousei, but you must wait until she dies, just so she can write it in a letter. And Kousei clearly loves Kaori, but he will only think it in his mind and never tell her outload. Neither of them ever tells the other, in person, that they love them. And Tsubaki is a total third wheel character, Kousei never has any romantic feelings for her and even when she tells him to ‘love her instead’ he kind of just shrugs it off like nothing. He’s so hopelessly in love with Kaori that there’s really no room for Tsubaki. And even at the end of the series it almost feels like a forced relationship between them, because you know she’s never going to be able to fill the hole Kaori left. And he never even gave her any romantic signs, it’s just weird. But the worst character of them all was Nagi Aiza. She becomes Kousei’s apprentice, but honestly, no one gives a shit about her. She takes up 2-3 episodes of character development, at a crucial time when Kaori is in hospital DYING. And it’s just like “I don’t give a shit about this character right now, show me Kousei & Kaori interacting at the hospital, they have so much to discuss” But nope, 22 episodes in this series, and 2-3 of them are wasted on Nagi, a character I will never care about. Anyway, I thought the final episode was nice, the way Kousei played the piano to her while she was being operated on, then she appeared in his vision and played alongside him, a beautiful final goodbye. And I guess it fit in the whole “speak through music to each other” theme of the show. It was a nice scene, but at the same time I wished they had a proper last visit with each other, in person, and confessed how they felt to one-another. Because the next scene after his performance was a skip to her funeral and I was kind of just like “What? Really she’s dead just like that?” I just wished they had talked more. All-in-all though it was a good Anime, personally I found it kind of unsatisfying, but still good. I recommend to most people. The music is good too, some of it is a little bit long though, and drags on, but most of it is good. It was a great, sad anime, but it’s not a masterpiece like most people claim. That is my honest opinion. 

Thanks for the memories “Your Lie in April” it was a fun ride, sad, but fun. Until we meet again

your lie in april,"Dear A – 1 picture and Mr. Naoshi Arakawa
Over this week, I watched the Your lie in April for the first time and I could get my mind out of the Sad ending, which Kaori did not pass the surgery. The ending is beautiful and emotional but it was hurt every time I watched it again. Kaori rises Kousei rescue him from the past, she gave him hope and another chance to play the piano. Despite the fact she had been sick for a long time and could not live any longer but she still tries to save Kousei live. 
I read a lot of Happy ending on Wattpad and it raise my feeling a little bit but there is something still hurt my mind likes Kousei will be left alone again with his feelings just like my childhood, which makes me have a courage to do this. I am begging A -1 pictures and Mr. Naoshi Arakawa, please make a Happy ending for both Arima Kousei and Miyanoro Kaori. I always imaged Kousei walk into the hospital after the performance and see Kaori resting after her success surgery and after that maybe they can marry or even have kids. And I know it is hard and take time, money and efforts.
But those two should live happy after all like Kousei talked in episode 8 Light of life: “I am going on a journey. Searching for that moment. When my music reaches someone amides wild applause. Search for that image of you. Until one day when we can walk together shoulder to shoulder.” This anime saved me from a lonely boy loves Oreo have issues in trust people and usually alone to a boy think that I should try to trust people more and enjoy every moment in life. I wish I had a friend like Kaori. 
I am sorry for the long letter. Thank you for reading all of this. I do not have email of Mr. Naoshi Arakawa, which I wish I had and could to him more, so I have to send in this. Please give me hope like Miyazono Kaori did.
Thank you.

And Kousei clearly loves Kaori, but he will only think it in his mind and never tell her outload. Neither of them ever tells the other, in person, that they love them. And Tsubaki is a total third wheel character, Kousei never has any romantic feelings for her and even when she tells him to ‘love her instead’ he kind of just shrugs it off like nothing. He’s so hopelessly in love with Kaori that there’s really no room for Tsubaki. And even at the end of the series it almost feels like a forced relationship between them, because you know she’s never going to be able to fill the hole Kaori left. And he never even gave her any romantic signs, it’s just weird. But the worst character of them all was Nagi Aiza. She becomes Kousei’s apprentice, but honestly, no one gives a shit about her. She takes up 2-3 episodes of character development, at a crucial time when Kaori is in hospital DYING. And it’s just like “I don’t give a shit about this character right now, show me Kousei & Kaori interacting at the hospital, they have so much to discuss” But nope, 22 episodes in this series, and 2-3 of them are wasted on Nagi, a character I will never care about. Anyway, I thought the final episode was nice, the way Kousei played the piano to her while she was being operated on, then she appeared in his vision and played alongside him, a beautiful final goodbye. And I guess it fit in the whole “speak through music to each other” theme of the show. It was a nice scene, but at the same time I wished they had a proper last visit with each other, in person, and confessed how they felt to one-another. Because the next scene after his performance was a skip to her funeral and I was kind of just like “What? Really she’s dead just like that?” I just wished they had talked more. All-in-all though it was a good Anime, personally I found it kind of unsatisfying, but still good. I recommend to most people. The music is good too, some of it is a little bit long though, and drags on, but most of it is good. It was a great, sad anime, but it’s not a masterpiece like most people claim. That is my honest opinion. 

Thanks for the memories “Your Lie in April” it was a fun ride, sad, but fun. Until we meet again

your lie in april,"There's only one word to describe this anime: exquisite.  When I first started to watch anime this was the first I watched and little did I know it would take me on a journey to another land. It opened my eyes to see what the world was like.  I can say,  in my first year, middle school, I met a boy under a full grown willow tree and my fate has begun to change.  Allowing me to fall in love.  I realize how much people take for granted now we only realize how much we love someone until after they're gone. I met this person only two years after and never thought we would ever become friends but as fate has it,  we did.  Then came 7th grade and we drifted.  I made a promise to myself to no matter what always love him until I graduate.  I've kept this promise every single day.  Your lie in April,  thank you for helping me love.",0.2525669642857143

digimon adventure,"It's not supposed to expand on the previous film, that would be a repetitive mechanic because Last Evolution Kizuna and The Beginning are two different movies with very different themes as well. Also the final frame of Last Evolution Kizuna after the credits is the answer to how Tai and the other original digidestined will recover their digimons. It's all about Tai Thesis about humans and digimons which is connected to his future job as we see in 02 Epilogue.  Somehow Tai in the future can find a way (after all Digimon are data).
Personally i prefer Adventure 01 movie and Adventure 02 movie having their own story. This movie can be very underwhelming for many fans but it's heavy plot once again about relationships, humans and digimons in a different and twisted way . That's the core of the franchise. New challenges and new conflicts and perspectives.",0.0353030303030303

digimon adventure,"I actually enjoyed the movie despite the negative hype. It's best if people watch the film without thinking much about previous movies and shows. I mean most recent digimon media often tries to rehash previous stories and relies on nostalgia. While not action-heavy, most of the scenes left much more of an impact with their tone, voice acting, and musical score. And unlike past entries, it doesn't actually contradict any existing plot elements and even addresses the conception that most digimon seem to be just reflections of their human partners. The ending was also much better than the previous ones.",0.12215909090909088

digimon adventure,"It's not supposed to expand on the previous film, that would be a repetitive mechanic because Last Evolution Kizuna and The Beginning are two different movies with very different themes as well. Also the final frame of Last Evolution Kizuna after the credits is the answer to how Tai and the other original digidestined will recover their digimons. It's all about Tai Thesis about humans and digimons which is connected to his future job as we see in 02 Epilogue.  Somehow Tai in the future can find a way (after all Digimon are data).
Personally i prefer Adventure 01 movie and Adventure 02 movie having their own story.

cardcaptor sakura,"The English subtitles' translation for this Blu-Ray are inaccurate. It's a downgrade from Rika Takahashi's translation that was on the Pioneer/Geneon DVD releases, which I got so used to I'd have to autocorrect the Blu-Ray's subtitles in my head every time, like when Sakura would say ""Oni-chan!"" but the subs reads ""Toya!"", or when Sakura addresses Shaoran with his last name with ""Li-Kun!"" but the subs indicates his first name. This is critical for the plot, aa she does not call him by his first name until near the end of the series, which is a milestone acknowledgement that she's closer to him than when they first met as rivals.

promised neverland,"I just finished my marathon of this show, for the second time, and I have the following to say (Spoilers) 
What a great, yet disappointing, show this was. I watched the first season In 2020 and liked it very much, would've recommended it to anyone. But then I re-watched it this year, in 2021 (including season 2 this time) and the first season was still good, but the second season was absolute trash, and really put a damper on the whole show. I'm not sure if I would recommended it to people now. If I had the summarize the show I'd do it in two parts. 

SEASON 1: 
Amazing, I really enjoyed it and would recommend to anyone looking for something new and exciting to watch. The three main characters are great, and each of them brings something new to the table. Norman is basically the boy prodigy, the best of all the children, and seems to be the 'man with the plan' for most of season 1. Ray seems to be just as smart as Norman (maybe) but darker and more suspicious of people, he's a very pessimistic character and he brings that vibe to the group, which is a good layer to the series. I get the impression Emma doesn't quite have the IQ of her male counterparts, but is physically superior, and has more compassion and empathy for people. She is the main character of the series and the driving force behind most of the groups plans. It's a really good dynamic and the three complement each other nicely. Season 1 is done really well, the thrill and suspense of the show was done superbly. And Isabella was great at the 'mother' figure of the household. When you realise she is actually the enemy it really gives off a sense of creepiness that I haven't seen in many Animes before. The other children were okay also, but kinda annoying, I was really only there for the main three. You almost feel hopeless when Norman is taken away, and Emma & Ray slip into depression, but then the 180 they do, to escape, is amazing. Great season, great ending, I really enjoyed it and give it a 8/10.

SEASON 2:
Terrible, I did not enjoy it at all. I'm not sure if there were budget cuts, writers strike, or some sort of production issues while making season 2, but something went wrong. Rushed doesn't even describe how forced the plot was in season 2, apparently they cut out like 150 chapters of the manga, and thought it was for the best. Everything about it was horrible. Emma became annoying, she was this over the top optimistic character that basically just kept repeating 'I wanna save everyone' or 'I don't wanna kill he demons' I get that's her thing, but it was too much and it just became annoying. Ray completely devolved as a character, it's like the writers didn't know what to do with him, he had no purpose, he was kind of just floating around, and his character felt very forced. Like, in season 1 he was the one suggesting leaving all the sibling behind because they were a burden to escape with, yet in season 2 he's agreeing with Emma that killing the demons is wrong, his character just felt off. And I don't even know wtf was going on with Norman in season 2. All the characters just imploded on themselves and nothing really made sense. In season 1 they spend all their time trying to escape a house, and climb over a wall, that was their mission. Yet in season 2 Norman is developing chemical weapons to shoot missiles into a town of demons and kill them, and Emma & Ray have mastered hunting and archery in a couple days. It was just way too forced, not to mention everything they needed for the plot just fell into their laps. Like finding a multi-million dollar complex that has electricity and hot water, just waiting for them. Or it just so happens that the one blind demon who is hanging around them has the cure in his blood for all demons, and his holding a microchip for the kids that not only gives them the blue-print of the bad guys layer, but also gives them the cure to Normans sickness (which you never see him develop) there's probably thousands of demons out there, and the one demon who's basically sharing an apartment with them is the one they need, how lucky. Every emotional moment in season 2 felt like nothing to me, it was so poorly done that I felt dead inside. Every time a character cried, I would look at the clock and wish I was doing something else, it was just bad. there were so many more problems but the end story is that everything in season 2 was bad. I'm not surprised this show didn't get a season 3. I give it a 2/10

CONCLUSION: 
Season 1 was great, go watch it. Season 2 was terrible, don't watch it. 

Thank you for the memories 'The Promised Neverland' it was an experience. I would say 'until we meet again' but I honestly don't want to...

promised neverland," @chirrimoya  I will tell the first dream (the second one was based off it so it's quite similar) basically one time i saw a video titled ""how to beat the demons in the promised neverland"" with that picture of dead connie, and the in the dream i had a bedroom in gracefield house with other kids and each night someone else got possessed by ""demons"" and it was basically a battle of the soul it was scary but realistic and its related to tpn so i love it 
edit: forgot to say that that frame of dead connie appeared in the dream",-0.010833333333333334

As for me(a Korean fan of both the webtoon and anime), I think the anime was a considerable success, good start for a webtoon original anime(just my opinion). I've actually been a bit disappointed by the ToG(tower of god-don't know the capitals sorry)cause it seemed they changed a lot from the original plot and story. But the GoH didn't seem to change a lot from the original story, and had extreme quality, so I felt it was worth to watch. Also, the extreme action scenes meant they had put a lot of effort and work in it, and that felt satisfying too.(the key point why i think it's better than toG)I know it's frustrating they had to put more than 100 chapters in this one anime; but you could see in the anime that they tried to show the main setups you need to understand the story. These could only be my opinion, but I've seen many korean fans agreeing to this. Regardless of the advantage/disadvantage of the anime, I wanna give a thumbs-up to the production crew for such a great anime producing. Thanks for the hard work!!",0.1674375

(신의 탑보다 낫다고 생각했던 키포인트)100편보다 많은 편수를 하나의 애니에 몰아넣었던 게 짜증나긴 했지만, 전체 스토리 이해를 위해 꼭 필요한 설정들은 표현한 걸 볼 수 있었어요. 그저 제 의견 뿐일 수도 있지만, 많은 한국 팬들도 대체로 이런 반응이었고요. 애니의 장점과 단점은 상관없이 애니의 제작진들께 아주 좋은 애니를 만들어 준 것에 대해 엄지를 추켜올려주고 싶네요. 고생 많으셨고 감사합니다!!

Thanks to producer park sung hoo and all the others that took part in the anime!
As for me(a Korean fan of both the webtoon and anime), I think the anime was a considerable success, good start for a webtoon original anime(just my opinion). I've actually been a bit disappointed by the ToG(tower of god-don't know the capitals sorry)cause it seemed they changed a lot from the original plot and story. But the GoH didn't seem to change a lot from the original story, and had extreme quality, so I felt it was worth to watch. Also, the extreme action scenes meant they had put a lot of effort and work in it, and that felt satisfying too.(the key point why i think it's better than toG)I know it's frustrating they had to put more than 100 chapters in this one anime; but you could see in the anime that they tried to show the main setups you need to understand the story. These could only be my opinion, but I've seen many korean fans agreeing to this. Regardless of the advantage/disadvantage of the anime, I wanna give a thumbs-up to the production crew for such a great anime producing. Thanks for the hard work!!",0.1674375

fullmetal alchemist,"I just finished my marathon of FMA & FMAB and I have to say the following…(Spoilers) 
I had watched the first episode of both series once before in the past, but they didn’t hook me in enough to stay. This time I decided to give it a proper go and watch more than one episode and I have to say, it was good. I was unsure which one to watch first, so I went in chronological order, FMA then FMAB. Once I finished the original series of 04, I was reasonably impressed, I liked the characters, animation and even the story telling. Though some things didn’t really make sense to me, but on a whole the original FMA was good. I’m still unsure on how I process the ending on the original series, I think I like it because it wasn’t cliché or safe. They kind of left it on a “wft” sort of note and I respect that. Especially the movie’s ending, Conqueror of Shamballa, which is supposed to be a conclusion to the original FMA series. 

Then I found out that “Brotherhood” wasn’t a sequel, that it was in fact the true adaptation of the manga. So, I was like “Okay, I’ll give that a watch too” As I began to watch it, I wasn’t that impressed, mostly because I felt like it was a cheap recreation of the original since the first 12-13 episodes are basically the same as the 04 series with minor changes. And I noticed that the Brotherhood’s animation was slightly more childlike, the characters chines were more circular instead of chiselled, and the show seemed to have more comedic segments than its predecessor. So, I was kind of scratching my head thinking “Why do people say brotherhood is better?” But then I got around episode 15, and the story went in a totally different direction than the original. And from then on out I can safely say Brotherhood is a better show than the original. The characters are just far better intertwined and developed in Brotherhood. For example, in the original series Roy (Flame alchemist) is the killer of Winry’s parents, and they never really resolve the issues, he admits to the murder, but she kind of just forgives him off screen and that’s it. In Brotherhood Scar is the murderer of Winry’s parents, which makes a lot more sense because he was over in the war at the same time they were on opposing sides. And Scar and Winry get to have some screen time and get to a resolution about how she forgives him. And in the original 04 FMA Scar ends up dying for Lust, which comes out of nowhere and doesn’t make any sense. Then he dies randomly after losing both arms. It just doesn’t fit. Though I will admit the original series did a far better job on the whole Scar vs Kimblee fight, brotherhood fails in that area. I mean they build it up for them to fight, then some random ass Lion man kills Kimblee and that’s the end of his character basically, such a waste. And I didn’t really like the ending of Brotherhood. Not only that Roy lost his vision and you never got to see him get it back, but also the way the relationships ended. I just sat through like 64 episodes I wanna see Ed kiss Winry for fucksake, show me some affection damn. Same thing goes for Roy & Hawkeye, you never see any real affection in this show. And the final episode, after all that trouble of getting Al’s body back and shit, he just takes off by himself somewhere. Like “thanks for everything, now bye” and the way Ed leaves Winry at the end, “I sort of love you, bye, cya in a couple months possibly years” There’s no way she isn’t fucking the mailman when he gets back. it was just an unsatisfying ending.

In conclusion if you are struggling to decide which series to watch, FMA or FMAB, I would urge you to watch Brotherhood over the original. There’s no real reason to watch the 04 version because it’s just a random story separate from the true manga, but if you got the time why not watch both. 

Thank you, Fullmetal Alchemist & Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood.  It was an experience, until we meet again

cyberpunk edgerunners,"What is the problem with making a second season about Cyberpunk: Edgerunners? When Johnny Silverhand attacked Arasaka, it was also shown how he was shot by Adam Smesher, but the next shot showed him sitting alive as a hostage in the corporation. Moreover, Smesher himself told David that he would have made a good construct. David's death during the shooting was not well shown. As for Rebecca, the story took place in 2076, thanks to technology, it would have been possible to repair her and in the first episodes of the second season Arasaka could have held her hostage, threatening her with death if David (as a test subject) refused to work for the corporation and wanted to go against them. Lucy may have gone to the moon, but after a while (after the events in the game) she returned and heard that David was alive. After that, she gathered a team and organized an attack on Arasaka!

magi kingdom of magic, @willem1941  my problem with FMAB is that the storyline moves really slow and doesn’t really come together until the very end. But my favorite anime I’ve watched so far is the rising of the shield hero. At least season 1 I’m not huge on season 2 yet,0.02857142857142856
magi kingdom of magic," @esavage8855  I watched the sub for black clover. I usually never watch a show in dub but I will definitely give it a try now with black clover. You have the exact same issue with FMAB as I do lol. 
Nice!!! Rising of the shield hero season 1 is definitely one of the better isekais out there. Can you write me how you liked MT after a few episodes? Everyone I know is knees deep into anime so I'm kinda interested to hear an opinion from someone who is fairly new to anime.",0.20853535353535352

magi kingdom of magic, @Ledwow fullmetal alchemist is legendary but its dark and complex. Kind of like Ergo Proxy.

They MC is made stupid just for plot, despite every other instance of them having common sense. He’s like a completely different person. Normally that’s good. But this is the opposite of any other character in fiction.

serial experiments lain,"Lain has very complecated plot imo. It could be seen as an allegory for a persons journey back from the material world to spirit. She starts as a normal girl but begins studying about computers and building advanced systems, realising that everyone is connected in this parallel world called wired. This could be the collective unconscious or ""heaven"". As time progresses lain become gradualy more detached from reality while delving deeper into this other world in a similar fashion that the enlightened person slowly withdrows from the material world of the flesh while omcreasing his presence in the spiritual realm. Mika on the other hand starts having all those messages from the wires about a prophesy but unlike Lain she eventually loses her mind and is rendered a mumbling mess. That could be symbolic of an awakening gone wrong, or a mental illness like psychosis. Then lain realizes her parents are not really her parents and that this world is not her true origin.

This might be symbolic of the darkness rushing to destroy an enlightened person before they break free from this illusive world. Lain wins though and eventually chooses to delete herself from existence and ascent to something higher. Thus why we see her at the end being everywhere at the same time.

It’s not that big of a deal. Getting off the topic, I found out about this movie when the Scotiabank Theatre in my area was advertising it through a sign inside the lobby and (not knowing about LoveLive in the first place) I decided to go see it since it was only in theatres on a certain day at a certain time. I immediately started feeling uncomfortable when they were giving out “limited edition” posters to those of us going to see the movie and later that uncomfortable feeling was replaced with a cringey feeling that lasted for 2 hours straight. Aside from that, it was quite a decent experience and makes me laugh every time I think about it.

The movie still sucked though, I like it as an ironic experience but every time I try to take it seriously I’m either disappointed, bored, or both. The first season of this LoveLive was worse though, at least the characters in the movie felt developed enough to have a bit of an attachment to them (even though they’re still poorly written and generic for the most part).",-0.0566468253968254
