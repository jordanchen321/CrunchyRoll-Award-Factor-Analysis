    "The Goal of this project is to investigate whether it is possible to predict the winner of Crunchyroll's Anime of the Year award using measurable popularity engagement, and production-related variables, in hopes of discovering relationships between fan engagement and media production within the anime industry. specifically, we aim to build a predictive model that uses factors like user rating(data from Crunchyroll, MyAnimeList), social-media engagement(sentiment analysis on Youtube data), hype indicators(trailer, views, and manga popularity), production characteristics(studio and budget) to produce a binary target variable (win/not win). How do factors like rating, engagement, hype, production, and release time affect an anime's chance at winning Crunchyroll's anime of the year? How accurately can we predict the next winner?\n"

    "The Crunchyroll Anime Awards is an annual awards ceremony organized by Crunchyroll, one of the world's largest anime streaming platforms. The Crunchyroll Anime Awards is an annual ceremony that recognizes the hard work of animators, producers, and other contributors, covering both fan favorites and critically acclaimed works.<a id=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1) This ceremony was first announced in December of 2016 with the winners presented in January of 2017. The awards feature many different categories which include, anime of the year, best opening or ending song, best voice actor for many different languages, best animation, global impact, and more. The awards begin with a panel of industry experts selecting nominees for each category, followed by a fan voting stage. For certain categories, expert judges may also evaluate submissions to ensure technical merit is considered. Finally, the winners are announced early in the year, typically between February and March. \n",

    "The market of anime, which are Japanese animated TV shows, has seen a major increase of success worldwide.<a id=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2) Anime has gained its popularity through not only its immersive storylines, but defining artstyles and unique screen effects. It is a very broad form of media with multiple genres such as romance and action, yet fans unite to enjoy all types of anime. Naturally, the amount of discussion surrounding it increased as well. As anime became more recognized, the most popular animes would be celebrated through annual anime awards.\n",
    "\n",
    "A recent academic paper by Jesús Armenta-Segura and Grigori Sidorov that was published on PubMed Central explored how freely available internet data such as plot descriptions and images can be used to predict anime popularity before large financial investments are made.<a id=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3) The researchers proposed a multimodal neural network that combines GPT-2 for text and ResNet-50 for image embeddings, achieving a mean squared error of 0.012 and an R² of 0.142. Their findings demonstrated that pre-production features like story summaries and character visuals are moderately correlated with an anime’s eventual popularity. \n",

    "We aim to predict the next Crunchyroll Anime of the Year winner by building a data-driven model using variables such as fan ratings, production studio identifiers, and pre-adaptation manga performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a meaningful analysis with these variables in place we will operationalize these factors. Fan ratings will be measured through aggregated scores from platforms such as MyAnimeList and AniList. Production studio identifiers will be obtained by searching for the name of studio, budget for production, and season the anime is released. Lastly pre-adaptation manga performances can be representated original manga populatrity. Manga popularity will be measured using circulation numbers prior to the anime’s release.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our rationale is that pre-adaptation manga performance will be a strong indication of the baseline performance of the anime. However, based on the studio and budget of the project, the production quality will be affected. If the production quality is good, then the performance of the anime should be enhanced, and if the production quality is bad, then the performance of the anime will be hindered. For example, Blue Lock was a highly anticipated anime based on manga popularity, but because of tight budget, the animation quality is lackluster, and this directly hindered the popularity of the anime despite high anticipation from the manga.\n",
    "\n",
    "We therefore hypothesize that the likelihood of an anime winning Anime of the Year will be most strongly associated with the interaction between high pre-adaptation manga popularity and favorable production conditions (e.g., strong studio track record and adequate budget), which together produce higher fan ratings and stronger overall audience response."

    "There are two main data sets here that will be merged into one: anime dataset and box office dataset. The merged data set will be done by matching the anime names of the Anime Dataset and Box Office Dataset. One major concern is that the spelling of the same anime can be done distinctly for each data set. For example, Anime data will have an entry called \"Devilman Crybaby\" while the Box Office data will have an entry called \"Devilman: Crybaby\". Because of this when we merge the two datasets we will obtain two separate entries as opposed to one. In order to counteract this we will normalize the anime names by removing punctuation, numbers, and words like Season, Part, The, etc. Additionally because the data contains entries like \"attack on titan\" and \"attack on titan final season\", we will keep the base name entry \"attack on titan\" and remove other entries that are built on the base anime, so we have one entry per anime.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, we had to consider the possibility that certain anime are unique to a data set. To address this concern we will merge the two entries and only keep the entries that appear in both datasets. However, because one of the eight Crunchyroll award winning anime \"Yuri on Ice\", \"Made in Abyss\", \"Devilman Crybaby\", \"Demon Slayer\", \"Jujutsu Kaisen\", \"Attack on Titan\", \"Cyberpunk Edgerunners\", \"Solo Leveling\" may be deleted we will forcibly keep all Crunchyroll award winning anime even if there will be NaN columns for their respective rows. We will then collect the missing data ourselves and enter them in manually. It is important for us to keep these Crunchyroll award winning anime because there are only 8 winners, so losing even a single one would be detrimental.\n",
    "\n",
    "As for concerns about the actual data itself, the main concern would be that the favorite column for the Anime Dataset only tells us how many people favorited the anime rather than the relative amount to how many people viewed the anime in general. Therefore having a higher favorited number may not necessarily indicate that more people enjoyed the anime because the anime may have simply garnered more views and thus more people favorited. Even though we have a total_views column from Box Office Dataset, because most people will and can view the anime multiple times it is not a good measure of how many people watched the anime.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most concerning data that is missing from these two dataset is the year the anime started airing and when it finished airing. This is because if the anime performed incredibly well with the general public but finished airing before CrunchyRoll award became a thing in 2017, that anime will never actually win the award. Therefore, it will be important for us to find another dataset that contains this information in order for us to group the anime by years.\n",

We plan on once again nromalizing the names, forcible keeping all crunchyroll award winners, and filing in the missing data manually when needed.

Simply looking at total approximate sales can be misleading: higher total sales may occur simply because a series has more volumes available, not necessarily because the manga itself is more popular. By focusing on average sales per volume, we can better compare the true popularity of different manga titles. \n",

    "We plan to use this metric to examine whether higher sales correlate with higher viewer scores and, ultimately, whether this influences an anime’s likelihood of winning a Crunchyroll award. We also hope to identify whether the author or publisher of the manga shows any correlation with its success. If such correlations exist, they may indicate that the original creator or publishing company plays a role in shaping the anime’s eventual performance. Our hypothesis is that the author will not significantly impact the manga’s commercial success, whereas the publisher will. This is primarily because authors typically do not control marketing or distribution; larger publishing companies, however, tend to have stronger marketing budgets and infrastructure, which can substantially boost a manga’s visibility and sales."

    "### A. Data Collection\n",
    " - [X] **A.1 Informed consent**: If there are human subjects, have they given informed consent, where subjects affirmatively opt-in and have a clear understanding of the data uses to which they consent?\n",
    "\n",
    "> The social media posts that we want to take data from will all contain publicly available posts. Assuming that they allow for people to see and discuss their posts, then we are also assuming that they consent to their data being used. We will not be taking data from places such as private accounts or direct messages between people. However, it is possible that people could still feel violated because they were not told that their posts would be used for data. There could also be more personal data that gets swept up in the process of us looking for data.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.2 Collection bias**: Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?\n",
    "> Because most of the data like anime rating are collected through viewer volunteerly rating the anime out of 10. We have to consider the possibility that only viewers with a strong viewpoint either positively or negatively will volunteerly rate the anime. \n",
    " - [ ] **A.3 Limit PII exposure**: Have we considered ways to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) for example through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?\n",
    " - [ ] **A.4 Downstream bias mitigation**: Have we considered ways to enable testing downstream results for biased outcomes (e.g., collecting data on protected group status like race or gender)?\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Data Storage\n",
    " - [ ] **B.1 Data security**: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?\n",
    " - [ ] **B.2 Right to be forgotten**: Do we have a mechanism through which an individual can request their personal information be removed?\n",
    " - [ ] **B.3 Data retention plan**: Is there a schedule or plan to delete the data after it is no longer needed?\n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Analysis\n",
    " - [X] **C.1 Missing perspectives**: Have we sought to address blindspots in the analysis through engagement with relevant stakeholders (e.g., checking assumptions and discussing implications with affected communities and subject matter experts)?\n",
    "> It is only public opinions that we are recording for our sentiment analysis. This could leave out many people who do not publicly voice their opinion but vote for the anime of the year award. This could potentially affect the accuracy of our data. Certain comments about an anime could also be based on memes or those who have not actually watched it, so there is also the issue of not being able to account for the seriousness of posts. There are also people who might not directly mention the name of the anime that they are referring to in their posts.\n",
    " - [ ] **C.2 Dataset bias**: Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?\n",
    " - [ ] **C.3 Honest representation**: Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data?\n",
    " - [ ] **C.4 Privacy in analysis**: Have we ensured that data with PII are not used or displayed unless necessary for the analysis?\n",
    " - [X] **C.5 Auditability**: Is the process of generating the analysis well documented and reproducible if we discover issues in the future?\n",
    "> As we are basing most of our data on public sentiment, there could be a lot of it that might not be reproducible. Posts can be deleted or edited. From there, it implies that the user may not consent to those words being used as data again. However, other sources of data, such as sales of merchandise, can be replicated.\n",
    "### D. Modeling\n",
    " - [X] **D.1 Proxy discrimination**: Have we ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies for variables that are unfairly discriminatory?\n",
    "> The models will be based purely on public reception, the resources, and companies involved in the creation of anime shows. In no way should we group fans and creators based on traits such as gender or ethnicity, even if we are trying to evaluate genres that people like. For example, it could be said that a romance anime would only get popular if the voters were majority female. It can create a close-minded and stereotypical view of these groups. We should instead focus on factors that anime fans as a whole will prefer, such as production quality.\n",
    " - [ ] **D.2 Fairness across groups**: Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g., tested for disparate error rates)?\n",
    " - [ ] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",
    " - [ ] **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?\n",
    " - [ ] **D.5 Communicate limitations**: Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?\n",
    "\n",
    "### E. Deployment\n",
    " - [ ] **E.1 Monitoring and evaluation**: Do we have a clear plan to monitor the model and its impacts after it is deployed (e.g., performance monitoring, regular audit of sample predictions, human review of high-stakes decisions, reviewing downstream impacts of errors or low-confidence decisions, testing for concept drift)?\n",
    "> There could be merchants and retailers that abuse this data to hoard stock for merchandise such as figurines, manga volumes, and DVDs that could create scarcity in markets. Not only that, but the scarcity can have resellers mark prices up, which could further impact the recreatability of our data.\n",
    " - [ ] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    " - [ ] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
    " - [X] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?\n",
    "> A potential issue that we have is that companies could use our data models to gain an unfair advantage against competitors in the industry. They could use this data and its implications to manipulate the odds towards themselves getting the award rather than letting the voting take its course naturally. This would not be fair towards other studios who are doing genuine hard work to have a fighting chance of winning. Similarly, the data could be weaponized to sabotage votes in ways such as using bot accounts to increase negative feedback on websites such as MyAnimeList."
